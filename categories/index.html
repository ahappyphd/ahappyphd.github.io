        Is Doctoral Productivity Bad?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>In this blog I have written <em>a lot</em> about doctoral <a href="https://ahappyphd.org/tags/productivity/">productivity</a> tools and advice. Yet, many doctoral students out there may also think that the focus on productivity is exploitative, dehumanizing, and counter to the very spirit of the scientific endeavor. Should we reject the quest for being productive altogether? Should we &ldquo;quiet quit&rdquo; our PhDs? This post tries to clarify what <em>I</em> mean by (doctoral) productivity, which may not be the &ldquo;narrow productivity&rdquo; view you find in certain research policy or journalistic articles about the topic. That way, you can decide whether it makes sense for you to follow my advice, or get it elsewhere.</p>

Is your mind an unfocused maelstrom of swirling thoughts, ruminating again and again about the same worrying (or plain silly) things? Journaling has been proposed (both by ancient philosophers and modern researchers) as having many benefits, from dealing with stress and trauma, to just understanding ourselves a little better. But, can journaling be useful for us in facing the challenges of a PhD?

      <p>Not a few of the people that read this blog, do so with a very clear outcome in mind: to finish their PhD, to get that damned piece of paper saying that they’re doctors. In this struggle, we (yes, I did that too) often forget that the PhD is more of a <em>process</em> (a learning, a practice) than it is an outcome. In this adaptation of a poem by Wendell Berry, I take a stab at what it took for me to become a researcher. I write this as much for you as for myself – to remind myself that, in a sense, we never cease to be students, we remain always beginners in the new knowledge that we (and others) create with our research.</p>

      <p>As our time at home increases due to quarantines and lockdowns, so does our opportunity to endlessly gossip, procrastinate or bitch about the global situation, our leaders and celebrities, or the people we happen to live with. Or, we could choose to be productive. We could choose to develop a new skill. Being mindful allows us to notice, in a non-judgmental way, the richness of life in and around us (yes, even when you’re locked down at home day after day). In this new kind of post (the “quickie”), I give you in brief a few reasons to develop such mindfulness, and three ways to start learning that skill, <em>today</em>.</p>

      <p>Is your PhD giving you beautiful dreams or horrible nightmares? In either case, you probably should be getting more of them. Sleep (or, rather, lack of sleep) is one of the best-known and most consistent <a href="https://ahappyphd.org/posts/risk-factors-phd/">risk factors related to depression, anxiety</a>, and host of other mental and physical health issues. It is also one of the factors (mostly) under our control &ndash; even if it often gets the back seat with respect to other priorities like work, social life, family, or the latest season of our favorite TV show. In this post, I review some of the (very extense, and rather terrifying) research about the effects that lack of sleep has on humans in general, and PhD students in particular. The post also points you to practices and resources to help you in sleeping not only longer, but also better. Keep your delicate mind and body machinery in optimal working condition!</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>In <a href="https://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/">a previous post</a>, we have seen the crucial role that having a sense of progress plays, not only in the productivity, but also in the engagement and persistence of a PhD student towards the doctorate. While this recognition (and the practices to &ldquo;make progress visible&rdquo; we saw) put a big emphasis on the student as the main active agent, PhD students are not the only actors in this play. Is there anything that doctoral <em>supervisors</em> can do to help? In this post, I go over some of the same management research on progress and our own evidence from the field, looking at what supervisors can do to support their students in perceiving continuous progress that eventually leads to a finished doctoral thesis.</p>

The normalcy of this experience, however, should not make us dismiss it as unimportant. In this post I review research that speaks to the importance of this sense of progress (or the lack of it) to our engagement with work and the eventual completion (or dropping out) of the PhD. The post also reviews several everyday practices to cultivate your own sense of progress.</p>

      <p>One would think that research, as the pursuit of new knowledge, is mostly based upon curiosity. However, the daily grind of research life can erode that sense of excitement students have about delving into the unknown. In this post, I explore the role of curiosity in doctoral studies, and look at a few practices and tricks to keep the flame of curiosity alight (without burning the village!).</p>

        How to deal with to-do list overwhelm

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The to-do list is an essential staple of an organized, reliable doctoral student (or academic). Yet, have you ever looked at your task list and felt anxious, certain that you have too much to do and too little time? In this post, I review several routines that have helped me overcome this ubiquitous feeling.
I have been working (in the industry and in academia) for about twenty years now. Yet, periodically, I look at my to-do list, or at the list of “projects I’m doing”, and I feel my heart rate rise.

        Choosing not to drop out: a view from self-determination theory
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>In <a href="https://ahappyphd.org/posts/drop-out-phd/">last week&rsquo;s post</a>, we established that dropping out of a Ph.D. (or thinking about it) is surprisingly common, and we saw demographic and socio-economic factors that seem related to doctoral attrition. In this post, I dive into another strand of research that relates doctoral dropout with a general theory of human motivation: <em>self-determination theory</em>. This research helps explain why you may persist and finish your doctorate (and even have fun doing it), despite having such socio-economic factors playing against you. Or vice-versa. The post also gleans practical advice from the literature on doctoral attrition, in the hope of helping students and supervisors avoid this common pitfall.</p>

      <p>The writing of a paper (or the dissertation itself) is often a long process, along which many decisions are made: should I send my ideas for feedback now, or generate more polished text? should I think of the target journal now or decide once I have the finished draft? et cetera. To finish this mini-series of posts on writing (<a href="https://ahappyphd.org/posts/why-writing-is-hard/">why writing papers is hard</a>, <a href="https://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/">how I write papers</a>, and <a href="https://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers2/">the second part of that writing process</a>), I review here the main principles and lessons that I have learned after more than 10 years of writing scientific papers.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Writing a paper is one of the hardest, but most creative parts of a Ph.D. Very often, we do not know where to start, what to do at what point, or when to get feedback from our collaborators. In <a href="https://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/">a previous post</a>, I started describing in detail the process I normally follow to write my scientific papers. This post explains the rest of the process, from the outlining until you send your manuscript off to the journal/conference. One would think that this is straightforward, just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejv2_CkZRHo">scribbling and scribbling</a>, right?</p>

      <p>There is plenty of advice out there on how to write academic publications, from general stylistic tips to field-specific guides. Yet, I&rsquo;ve found most of that advice tends to be abstract, or focused on the final product, never giving you a step-by-step account of the process. In this post, I share the writing process I find myself using after 70+ academic publications. This will give you an idea of where to start writing your paper (especially if you have never written one), and it will show you that all polished papers have humble (even crappy) origins. Kill perfectionism, and the dreaded &ldquo;academic writer&rsquo;s block&rdquo; will eventually disappear.</p>

      <p>As a follow-up to <a href="https://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/">the first post in this blog</a>, I dig a little deeper in some of the research on anxiety and depression during doctoral studies, to find &ldquo;risk factors&rdquo; and &ldquo;correlates&rdquo; that seem to often come along these depressive symptoms. I hope that the awareness of these factors (from gender to other things you can actually change in your everyday life) will help you understand why some people struggle doing a PhD, while for others it seems a piece of cake.

Are you supervising doctoral students, but feel like you are basically &ldquo;improvising&rdquo;, or following whatever behaviors your advisors applied with you, and wonder why nobody teaches you how to do this, why there is no handbook on how to give effective advice?
