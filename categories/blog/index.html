      <p>One of the catalysts that kickstarted this blog was the realization that <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/">PhD students are at a higher risk of mental health problems</a> than other students and professionals. Yet, how bad is the problem really? Exactly how many PhD students are <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/am-i-normal/">suffering</a> from depression or severe anxiety <em>right now</em>? How many will <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/drop-out-phd/">drop out</a>? In this quickie post, I pull from the data of a few recent studies to give a concrete, numeric <del>answer</del> guesstimate to these questions.</p>

      <p>Journaling during your doctorate can have a <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/journaling-benefits/">host of benefits</a> (for self-knowledge, mental and physical health). However, not everyone will benefit to the same degree, and different kinds of journaling have different advantages&hellip; if done correctly over a sustained period of time. In this post, I will go over different research-backed journaling exercises and tips to make your journaling most effective.</p>

      <p>Do you ever get the feeling, at the end of the day, that you have achieved nothing? or that days and weeks pass by, indistinguishable from one another, time slipping away like water between your fingers? Is your mind an unfocused maelstrom of swirling thoughts, ruminating again and again about the same worrying (or plain silly) things? Journaling has been proposed (both by ancient philosophers and modern researchers) as having many benefits, from dealing with stress and trauma, to just understanding ourselves a little better. But, can journaling be useful for us in facing the challenges of a PhD? In this post, I will take a look at the research on different kinds of journaling and what are their effects for mental and physical health.</p>

        Quickie: A simple trick to get better answers to your open questions

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>During a PhD (or any research) we need to answer not only the research questions we have set for ourselves, but also a host of other questions. Many of them are reflective and/or open in nature. Yet, we often slap whatever answer first pops into our brains, and run with it. In today&rsquo;s &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; post, I share a simple practice that can help in getting over this <a href="https://fs.blog/2021/06/availability-bias-cognitive-distortion/">availability bias</a> to get deeper, better answers to your open reflective questions.</p>

      <p>Doctoral Consortia are events (often, at scientific conferences) where doctoral students present their dissertation ideas and get expert feedback on them. I have co-organized a few of these events during the first waves of the pandemic, which students seemed to find useful (the events, not the pandemic!). In this post, I describe the (online) event format that we followed, in case it helps future organizers of similar events. If you are a PhD student, I hope this post will also encourage you to attend one!</p>

      Aside from PhD students&rsquo; own motivational factors (e.g., how much progress they perceive, or how exhausted they are), the support they receive from supervisors is another key aspect related to doctoral completion. In the continuation of last week&rsquo;s &ldquo;study report&rdquo;, we discuss how different kinds of supervisor support relate to those motivational factors and, eventually, the finishing of the doctorate. We will also see how supervisors could foster these motivational aspects and help their students complete the PhD.

      Many factors seem to play out into whether we complete our PhD, or drop out of it. Some of them are external and largely uncontrollable (like financial or family problems), while others relate to our thesis project and motivation. In this new type of blog post (the &ldquo;study report&rdquo;), I dive into the results of a recent research study that defines five types of doctoral students, in terms of their motivational profile.

      <p>As we saw <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/productivity-challenges/">in a recent post</a>, “task conflict” is a common productivity challenge of doctoral students. As PhD students, we often have to juggle different identities, priorities, jobs, projects… along with doing the thesis itself. Yet, so often, it is the thesis-related tasks that keep getting pushed back. In this post, I will go over tips, practices and techniques that might be useful if you find yourself struggling with this particular challenge in your PhD.</p>

In this post, I share the three most frequently-appearing productivity problems voiced in doctoral workshops we have run in Estonia and Spain. I hope this shows PhD students that they are not alone&hellip; and gives PhD supervisors hints about the hurdles their students often face (whether they mention them explicitly or not).

Don&rsquo;t be fooled by its simplicity: it&rsquo;s much more effective than &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; meetings, but people (including ourselves) will resist it fiercely, because it feels unnatural to act against our internalized meeting routines.

In this post, I review some of the (very extense, and rather terrifying) research about the effects that lack of sleep has on humans in general, and PhD students in particular. The post also points you to practices and resources to help you in sleeping not only longer, but also better. Keep your delicate mind and body machinery in optimal working condition!</p>

        Advising for progress: tips for PhD supervisors

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>In <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/">a previous post</a>, we have seen the crucial role that having a sense of progress plays, not only in the productivity, but also in the engagement and persistence of a PhD student towards the doctorate. While this recognition (and the practices to &ldquo;make progress visible&rdquo; we saw) put a big emphasis on the student as the main active agent, PhD students are not the only actors in this play. Is there anything that doctoral <em>supervisors</em> can do to help? In this post, I go over some of the same management research on progress and our own evidence from the field, looking at what supervisors can do to support their students in perceiving continuous progress that eventually leads to a finished doctoral thesis.</p>

      <p>Have you ever felt like you are &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in your PhD, making no progress, or going in circles? If so, you are in good company &ndash; most PhD students report such experience at one time or another during their doctoral process. The normalcy of this experience, however, should not make us dismiss it as unimportant. In this post I review research that speaks to the importance of this sense of progress (or the lack of it) to our engagement with work and the eventual completion (or dropping out) of the PhD. The post also reviews several everyday practices to cultivate your own sense of progress.</p>

Particularly, how positive connections and prosocial behaviors can help us <em>thrive</em> at work (not just survive).

This research helps explain why you may persist and finish your doctorate (and even have fun doing it), despite having such socio-economic factors playing against you. Or vice-versa. The post also gleans practical advice from the literature on doctoral attrition, in the hope of helping students and supervisors avoid this common pitfall.</p>

      <p>Aside from the fact that doing a Ph.D. <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/">seems to put you at a greater risk of being anxious or depressed</a> than other occupations, some students may also face the question: will I ever finish my thesis <em>at all</em>?

      <p>The writing of a paper (or the dissertation itself) is often a long process, along which many decisions are made: should I send my ideas for feedback now, or generate more polished text? should I think of the target journal now or decide once I have the finished draft? et cetera. To finish this mini-series of posts on writing (<a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/why-writing-is-hard/">why writing papers is hard</a>, <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/">how I write papers</a>, and <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers2/">the second part of that writing process</a>), I review here the main principles and lessons that I have learned after more than 10 years of writing scientific papers. I hope they help you navigate these decisions if you are in doubt, or if you have to step out of the usual writing process due to unexpected events.</p>

      <p>Writing a paper is one of the hardest, but most creative parts of a Ph.D. Very often, we do not know where to start, what to do at what point, or when to get feedback from our collaborators. In <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/">a previous post</a>, I started describing in detail the process I normally follow to write my scientific papers. This post explains the rest of the process, from the outlining until you send your manuscript off to the journal/conference. One would think that this is straightforward, just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejv2_CkZRHo">scribbling and scribbling</a>, right?</p>

      <p>There is plenty of advice out there on how to write academic publications, from general stylistic tips to field-specific guides. Yet, I&rsquo;ve found most of that advice tends to be abstract, or focused on the final product, never giving you a step-by-step account of the process. In this post, I share the writing process I find myself using after 70+ academic publications. This will give you an idea of where to start writing your paper (especially if you have never written one), and it will show you that all polished papers have humble (even crappy) origins. Kill perfectionism, and the dreaded &ldquo;academic writer&rsquo;s block&rdquo; will eventually disappear.</p>

      <p>As a follow-up to <a href="http://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/">the first post in this blog</a>, I dig a little deeper in some of the research on anxiety and depression during doctoral studies, to find &ldquo;risk factors&rdquo; and &ldquo;correlates&rdquo; that seem to often come along these depressive symptoms. I hope that the awareness of these factors (from gender to other things you can actually change in your everyday life) will help you understand why some people struggle doing a PhD, while for others it seems a piece of cake. Change what you do and put the odds on your side!</p>

      <p>There is a growing body of research that indicates that doing a doctoral dissertation can be taxing on the mental health of PhD students, with depression, anxiety, or burnout as potential pitfalls. Is this problem real and, if so, how bad is it? In this post, I review several recent studies, some of which also offer insights about potential risk factors. This also kickstarts the whole idea of this blog, as a way to increase awareness about these difficulties, and offer practical tips and tricks to survive such a difficult period.</p>
