      <p>Being a Ph.D. student and being happy sometimes feel like two incompatible states. We know of factors that affect your wellbeing, like your supervisor style or whether you have financial support. Yet, is there anything that you can actually do to make your worklife better, once the ball is rolling? In this post, I reuse research about &ldquo;happiness at work&rdquo; to propose actions and routines to help you cross the PhD desert with a (bigger) smile on your face.</p>

      <p>Is your supervisor ignoring you? or maybe overwhelming you with tasks and feedback? is that how s/he perceives it? Supervision style is one of the factors that seem to affect most PhD students&rsquo; mental wellbeing. However, we tend to take it for granted, as just a small quirk of our environment. In this post I go through some of the research on supervision styles and PhD student wellbeing and success. I also share a few things you might try in order to make your student/supervisor relationship a bit less&hellip; bumpy.</p>

      <p>As a Ph.D. student you have plenty to keep track of: course sessions and deadlines, reading papers, writing papers, submitting papers, designing studies, gathering data, analyzing or reporting it&hellip; As an advisor, you may remember with nostalgia the blissful time when you were a PhD and had only one research line. How can anyone stay on top of this insurmountable pile of deadlines and to-dos? It turns out, many people have faced this problem before, and have came up with systematic ways of solving it. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of these systems and variations (and I still experiment!). In this post, I will give you the gist of some of them, and the pros and cons that I have found by using them in real (academic) life. But, as they often say, &ldquo;your mileage may vary&rdquo;!</p>

In this post, I go over a technique that the president of a large US research lab pointed me to. I will walk you through its simple four-part structure, including some real examples from my own work.

      <p>Sending papers to the wrong scientific venue is one of the most common causes for rejection I see every day. I choose my audience as one of the first steps in my process for writing papers. But, how do you do that exactly? Based on impact? Quality? Who&rsquo;s the editor or chair? In this post, I go over steps and criteria that I use to find out where to send a particular piece of research work. Never go very far in the writing without a clear idea about this!</p>

      <p>There is plenty of advice out there on how to write academic publications, from general stylistic tips to very field-specific guides. Yet, I&rsquo;ve found most of that advice tends to be abstract, never giving you a step-by-step account of the process. In this post, I share the process to I find myself using after 50+ academic publications. This will give you an idea of where to start writing your paper (especially if you have never written one), and will show you that all polished papers have humble (even crappy) origins. Kill perfectionism, and the dreaded &ldquo;academic writer&rsquo;s block&rdquo; will fade away.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>As a follow-up to the first post in this blog, I dig a little deeper in some of the research on anxiety and depression during doctoral studies, to find &ldquo;risk factors&rdquo; and &ldquo;correlates&rdquo; that seem to often come along these depressive symptoms. I hope that the awareness of these factors (from gender to things you can actually change in your everyday life) will help you understand why some people have tons of difficulty in doing a PhD, while for others it seems a piece of cake. And maybe also change what you do to put the odds on your side.</p>

        Productivity tip: the Pomodoro technique
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I&rsquo;ve been using for many years.  I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, how to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!</p>

        PhD tool: The CQOCE diagram

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>By far, this is the tool (as in, &ldquo;thinking tool&rdquo;) which I recommend most often to PhD students. This diagram summarizes your main research questions, thesis contributions and evidence of their usefulness. While painful to make, this brutal synthesis exercise is also a powerful communication tool. In this post, I explain how it works, its origins, and how making 18+ versions of it helped me through my PhD. Copy the provided template and use it in your PhD supervision meetings or even in the PhD defense!</p>

        Is doing a Ph.D. bad... for your mental wellbeing?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>There is a growing body of research that indicates that doing a doctoral dissertation can be taxing on the mental health of PhD students, with depression, anxiety, or burnout all on the table. Is this problem real and, if so, how bad is it? In this post, I review several recent studies, some of which also offer insights about potential risk factors. This also kickstarts the whole idea of this blog, as a way to increase awareness about these difficulties, and offer practical tips and tricks to survive such a difficult period.</p>
