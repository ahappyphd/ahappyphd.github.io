      <title>Is doing a Ph.D. bad... for your mental wellbeing?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a growing body of research that indicates that doing a doctoral dissertation can be taxing on the mental health of PhD students, with depression, anxiety, or burnout all on the table. Is this problem real and, if so, how bad is it? In this post, I review several recent studies, some of which also offer insights about potential risk factors. This also kickstarts the whole idea of this blog, as a way to increase awareness about these difficulties, and offer practical tips and tricks to survive such a difficult period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>About A Happy PhD Are you doing a doctoral dissertation and feeling a bit lost, or unworthy, or just not knowing where to start, how to order your ideas and work effectively? Do you feel like everyone else is finding their path &amp;ldquo;naturally&amp;rdquo;, but you don&amp;rsquo;t?
Are you supervising doctoral students, but feel like you are basically &amp;ldquo;improvising&amp;rdquo;, or following whatever behaviors your advisors applied with you, and wonder why nobody teaches you how to do this, why there is no handbook on how to give effective advice?</description>
