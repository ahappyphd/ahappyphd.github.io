      <description>&lt;p&gt;Co-writing a paper, especially beyond one or two co-authors, can become a protracted process. If, on top of that, you try to have multiple feedback cycles (as &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/writing-papers-series/&#34;&gt;we recommend&lt;/a&gt;), co-authoring a paper can feel like swimming in molasses. This brief post describes how the most effective PhD students I know handle this kind of feedback situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever spent hours providing feedback over a colleague&amp;rsquo;s (or a student&amp;rsquo;s) paper? And have you ever found afterwards that many of your carefully-crafted, thoughtful comments had been ignored? In this &amp;ldquo;quickie&amp;rdquo; post for supervisors (or for anyone giving internal feedback), I share a small trick that I use lately to avoid these situations&amp;hellip; and get better outcomes for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This time I would like to turn the mike over to you, PhD students, and let &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; tell &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; what you want to hear about in this blog (I will do a separate one for supervisors and supervision later on). What would you like to know about doing a Ph.D., or being a (happier, more productive) PhD student?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
