      <title>Forget New Year&#39;s resolutions -- Do a Yearly Review instead</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/yearly-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like most of us, by now (end of February) your New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions will have fallen by the wayside. In recent years, I have stopped doing resolutions altogether. This post is about what I do now instead, heeding the advice of productivity systems and psychotherapy approaches: &lt;strong&gt;a yearly review&lt;/strong&gt;. This post goes over my particular yearly review process, and how it can give your research motivation (and satisfaction with life) a yearly boost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Journaling during your doctorate can have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/journaling-benefits/&#34;&gt;host of benefits&lt;/a&gt; (for self-knowledge, mental and physical health). However, not everyone will benefit to the same degree, and different kinds of journaling have different advantages&amp;hellip; if done correctly over a sustained period of time. In this post, I will go over different research-backed journaling exercises and tips to make your journaling most effective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I revise my journal papers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/writing-papers-series/&#34;&gt;writing your first journal paper&lt;/a&gt;, doing a substantial revision to your manuscript upon receiving the reviewersâ€™ comments is one often-cited painful moment of any doctoral process. This complex act of scientific communication involves balancing diplomacy with integrity, creativity and systematicity. In this post, I go over the concrete (and, sometimes, counter-intuitive) steps I follow to revise my journal papers upon receiving peer-review critiques, as well as some basic principles to increase your chances of success and avoid unnecessary suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Report from the trenches: of calendar tricks and time scarcity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I proposed the use of your favorite calendar app to store all your TO-DOs and avoid over-committing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying this productivity trick on myself for the past few months. In this new kind of blog post, I report on the results of this self-experiment, and the effect it has had on my own productivity and wellbeing. I also provide some practical tips and tricks, in case you want to try it out for yourself. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/a&gt;: It works&amp;hellip; if you are a bit careful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the emphasis I have made so far in developing productive and healthy everyday routines (from &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;to-do lists&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/pomodoro-technique/&#34;&gt;pomodoros&lt;/a&gt;), not everything about productivity happens at this tactical, day-to-day level. In this short post, I guide you through what I think is the centerpiece of my own personal productivity system: the weekly review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing research papers is one of the most dreaded (and most unavoidable) activities for many people during the PhD. In this series of posts I explore some of the reasons why writing research papers is difficult when one arrives at the PhD, and explain what concrete writing process I find myself following after more than a decade of academic writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
