      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a doctoral student struggling to move your dissertation forward, especially in the face of additional jobs, teaching, family, or other obligations, the thought of becoming more productive can be very appealing &amp;ndash; to the point of becoming a sort of obsession. After our review of (somewhat caricaturesque) &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-productivity-bad/&#34;&gt;doctoral productivity and anti-productivity arguments&lt;/a&gt;, in this post I summarize some of the ideas in Oliver Burkeman&amp;rsquo;s recent book, &lt;em&gt;Four thousand weeks&lt;/em&gt;, which I have found very helpful to reach a balance between my own productivity obsessions and the abandoning of all hope of being any good at my daily research activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does the thesis bring you a sense of anxiety, fear or discomfort? As we saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/am-i-normal/&#34;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, that is not an uncommon experience at certain points during the PhD. At the heart of many of our unsuccessful strategies to deal with these symptoms (including distraction and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/addiction/&#34;&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;) is the notion of avoidance. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explain what avoidance is, its key role in many mental health afflictions, and suggest exercises and strategies to help us overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
