      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog I have often covered the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/risk-factors-phd/&#34;&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/&#34;&gt;wellbeing problems&lt;/a&gt; that may come with doing a PhD, if we are not careful. In this series of posts I look at the flip side of that, diving into the research on &lt;em&gt;thriving&lt;/em&gt; at work, to find out which practices may help us be a little happier during our research, and how to diagnose ourselves about what aspects of our research activity can most be improved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Happiness in the lab, part 5: Kindness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even if you feel that your research contributes to a bigger purpose, even if you work at it with great engagement, even if you&amp;rsquo;re resilient to setbacks and misfortune&amp;hellip; still your time working in research can suck. This week I look at the final missing piece in our search for a happier (research) workplace: the quality of our social interactions with others. Particularly, how positive connections and prosocial behaviors can help us &lt;em&gt;thrive&lt;/em&gt; at work (not just survive). In this post, I examine some of the main components of a prosocial workplace, how to assess them for yourself, and a few research-backed practices to make your lab a kinder place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
