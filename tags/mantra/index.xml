      <description>&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of research as rational, mechanistic, sterile, orderly. However, there are many things about research that are random, chaotic, and require loads of creativity (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/writing-papers-series/&#34;&gt;writing papers&lt;/a&gt; being only one example among many). Thus, it sometimes makes sense to think about research as an art… and sometimes we can reuse tricks and advice from the arts, to make better science. In this brief post, I give you a couple of those, from a well-known artist and writer, in the form of two &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/&#34;&gt;Monday Mantras&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasing restrictions on movement and other aspects of life, also come anxiety, fear and a strange sense of unreality. Doing anything related to your PhD seems unusually hard, or pointless… even dangerous, compared with being continuously in the lookout for the latest news or advice on what to do. In this post, I share a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/&#34;&gt;mantra&lt;/a&gt; and a few other tips that I use to help myself stay sane and (kinda) productive in these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to pay attention is one of the most important assets of a PhD student (or researcher) and plays a crucial role on our focus and productivity, but also on our creativity and wellbeing. In this month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I give you not one, but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; sentences that you can use to remind yourself to manage this resource wisely. Choose your favorite!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt that you have too many threads open in your research work, and you cannot seem to make substantial progress in any of them? You are not alone. After closing the long series of posts on &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/happiness-in-the-lab-series/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;happiness in the lab&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, a bit of a lighter read this week. In this post I give very short advice that you can use as a &amp;ldquo;mantra&amp;rdquo; for this and the coming weeks, somewhat related to staying productive &amp;ndash; but with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we present our research to others, in a conference or in writing, we often feel insecure: is what I found obvious? is there a fatal flaw in my reasoning or my data analysis? will the audience finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&#34;&gt;unmask me as the impostor I am&lt;/a&gt;? This week&amp;rsquo;s short &amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo; goes at the heart of such unproductive self-talk. What is all this really about?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A shorter post this week, to warn you about a small hiatus in the blog (due to taking a &amp;ldquo;disconnected break&amp;rdquo;), and to propose a new post format: Monday Mantras. As the first exercise in this format, I propose you use the best shortest productivity advice I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
