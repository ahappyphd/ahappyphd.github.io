      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the top &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/productivity-challenges/&#34;&gt;barriers to PhD productivity&lt;/a&gt; is procrastination. Have you ever found yourself with a big ugly task getting stale in your to-do list, repeatedly postponed because it is too big, too abstract, or makes you somehow uncomfortable? This tiny practice post gives you an simple trick to beat this sort of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ChatGPT&#39;s doctoral productivity advice... and four ideas the algorithm will (probably) not give you</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/&#34;&gt;making progress&lt;/a&gt; is a critical motivational factor in finishing a PhD &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; maintaining good mental health while we do it. In turn, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/tags/productivity/&#34;&gt;productivity&lt;/a&gt; plays a big role in whether we make progress on our dissertation or not. As the first post in a series on doctoral productivity, I could not help but fall into one of the &lt;em&gt;thèmes du jour&lt;/em&gt;: whether ChatGPT and similar artificial intelligence (AI) tools can write a good piece about this topic. In this post, I go over a couple of iterations of (pretty good) computationally-generated advice, and finally give you a few ideas that I think are overlooked by the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tiny idea: Use the Regret Test for daily decision-making</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/tiny-regret/</link>

      <description>Have you ever spent an hour scrolling on Instagram (or your ​social media addiction of choice​) and later realized with a pang of regret that such a time could have been spent much better doing something else you deeply ​value​? This sort of realization is at the core of this week&amp;rsquo;s blog post: a tiny practice to guide our daily decision making about what to do next. This idea will also be familiar to long-time newsletter subscribers, as it was an early “newsletter exclusive”.</description>

      <title>Breathing through the PhD: Breathwork in the doctorate</title>

      <guid>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/breathing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the doctorate (and in our later lives as researchers) we have to deal with a wide variety of situations and tasks, some stressful, some requiring focus or calmness. Going to therapy, doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/avoidance/&#34;&gt;therapy-inspired reflection exercises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/tags/journaling/&#34;&gt;journaling&lt;/a&gt;, and other practices are all very useful, but they require us to step &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from the difficult situation. If only there was a simple, free, portable tool to help us in such situations, something we could do in any occasion and which is evidence-based&amp;hellip; Wait, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;! This post is about &lt;strong&gt;breathwork&lt;/strong&gt;, an array of tools with an increasing body of scientific evidence demonstrating its effectiveness. The post describes how we should breathe for better health and cognitive performance, and how different kinds of breathing patterns can help us cope with common challenging situations throughout the PhD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our efforts to fix our life&amp;rsquo;s problems, we often keep adding stuff to our lives and ideas to our theses, ignoring there&amp;rsquo;s an alternative. In another tiny post, I quickly share how you can harness the power of subtraction. &lt;em&gt;This idea will be familiar to long-time &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/newsletter/&#34;&gt;newsletter subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, as it was an early &amp;ldquo;newsletter exclusive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all tend to delay difficult, uncertain or scary tasks unnecessarily&amp;hellip; especially, those related to our thesis. How to avoid such procrastination? In this new kind of short post (so far only available to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/newsletter/&#34;&gt;our newsletter subscribers&lt;/a&gt;), I share tiny practices or ideas that have had an outsized effect on my thinking or my research practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A happy Master thesis: Progress and appropriation even before the PhD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feelings of being stuck, of not knowing where we’re going, self-doubt, guilt… are not exclusive to the doctoral thesis journey. Despite their smaller scope, other long projects with little feedback or structure (like a master thesis) share the same motivational pitfalls and may induce the same kind of uncomfortable experience at times. In this two-part post series, we review key advice and simple practices which could also be useful to help us face these capstone projects. But these can also be very useful if you are a PhD student just starting out!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intervision: Unblocking yourself... with a little help from some friends</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a PhD (and as doctoral supervisors) we often face situations where we feel blocked, with no idea of how to get out  or what to do next. In this post, the first of a series distilling wisdom from the latest round of &amp;ldquo;A Happy PhD&amp;rdquo; workshops, we look at a peer advice technique we have repeatedly use in the workshops to help students (and supervisors!) unblock. All you need is&amp;hellip; a little help from a small group of people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have established that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/scheduling-strategies/&#34;&gt;finding long periods of time&lt;/a&gt; for deep, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/create-consume/&#34;&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; research tasks (be it writing a paper or designing our next study) is critical to achieve our thesis &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/map-thesis/&#34;&gt;milestones&lt;/a&gt; and finish the PhD. Yet, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/execution/&#34;&gt;we are all very busy&lt;/a&gt; and have limited time for such creativity. To help in solving this conundrum, this short post describes a technique I&amp;rsquo;ve been using lately to squeeze a few extra hours a week to make headway in those hard, creative research tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Very often, the myriad of obligations, additional tasks, jobs and activities in our daily lives block us from making progress in our most important goals (like finishing that doctoral thesis!). This is especially true of part-time doctoral students that have a day job to make ends meet, but even full-time students face this challenge. Our behavior needs to change, but we can&amp;rsquo;t find what to change (or the energy to do it).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to concentrate and do focused, cognitively-demanding work is crucial to finishing a PhD (and doing research in general). Yet, we often spend our days in emails, meetings and other busywork that does not bring us closer to completing our goal (e.g., the thesis!). How to keep the busyness at bay so that we dedicate more time to the important stuff? In this post, the first of a series based on Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s classic book &lt;em&gt;Deep Work&lt;/em&gt;, we look at the high-level shape of a deep-worker&amp;rsquo;s calendar. What are the strategies that doctoral students have successfully used to find time to advance in producing their thesis materials?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Create/Consume Hypothesis: A simple rule for more effective and valuable PhD work</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you start your workday full of energy and eager to tackle your research but find yourself by mid-morning already spent and demoralized? Does this happen after a flurry of email interactions, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/social-media-addiction/&#34;&gt;social media scrolling&lt;/a&gt;, or passive meetings? You may be experiencing the differential effects of creative and consumptive work on your motivation and energy. This post will go over a (still half-baked) idea about how different kinds of work energize us, and simple rules that we can implement for a more sustained sense of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/&#34;&gt;progress&lt;/a&gt; and satisfaction with our (PhD or otherwise) work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Are you spending more time on social media than you would like? Is your use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok&amp;hellip; hampering progress on your doctoral research? You are not alone: many doctoral students report in our workshops that spending too much time scrolling compulsively on social media is one of their biggest productivity challenges. Building upon the insights about dopamine and addiction from our previous post, here I go over eight concrete steps we can take to break this compulsion and do more of the things we think are really important (like finishing that thesis).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like most of us, by now (end of February) your New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions will have fallen by the wayside. In recent years, I have stopped doing resolutions altogether. This post is about what I do now instead, heeding the advice of productivity systems and psychotherapy approaches: &lt;strong&gt;a yearly review&lt;/strong&gt;. This post goes over my particular yearly review process, and how it can give your research motivation (and satisfaction with life) a yearly boost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In previous posts, we have seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/chronobiology/&#34;&gt;how chronotype can influence our productivity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/chrono-breaks/&#34;&gt;how we can tweak our breaks&lt;/a&gt; to make the most of the ebbs and flows of our daily energy. But, how exactly can we use this chronobiology knowledge to craft a daily routine that is both productive and healthy, and fitting to our particular situation? In this post, I borrow from the habits and routines of an expert on the topic (Stanford neurobiologist Andrew Huberman) ten easy protocols you can put in practice to make every day your best day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being the &amp;ldquo;cognitive athletes&amp;rdquo; they are, PhD students (and researchers) should take &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; very seriously, to perform at their best. Yet, not all breaks are created equal: timing and other factors affect their effectiveness. Continuing previous dives into &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/chronobiology/&#34;&gt;chronobiology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/holidays/&#34;&gt;taking holidays&lt;/a&gt;, this post goes over evidence-based tips and tricks to make your breaks the most restorative and energizing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned that uncomfortable emotions (like guilt, anxiety or indecision) are one of the most common obstacles to productivity that our PhD students report. In preparation for a longer series of posts on &amp;ldquo;emotional first aid for the PhD&amp;rdquo;, I have found a short mental exercise that has helped me face those difficult emotions lately. Here it is, in the form of a card-based &amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/productivity-challenges/&#34;&gt;in a recent post&lt;/a&gt;, “task conflict” is a common productivity challenge of doctoral students. As PhD students, we often have to juggle different identities, priorities, jobs, projects… along with doing the thesis itself. Yet, so often, it is the thesis-related tasks that keep getting pushed back. In this post, I will go over tips, practices and techniques that might be useful if you find yourself struggling with this particular challenge in your PhD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel, during your PhD, that you are not “productive enough”? Guess what, you are not alone. In this post, I share the three most frequently-appearing productivity problems voiced in doctoral workshops we have run in Estonia and Spain. I hope this shows PhD students that they are not alone&amp;hellip; and gives PhD supervisors hints about the hurdles their students often face (whether they mention them explicitly or not). Also, I will give a couple of simple rules to know if these are a problem for you particularly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yet, even if we find them, can we really sustain intense focus during two or more hours? Today&amp;rsquo;s post looks at a research-backed and often overlooked tool in our productivity toolbox: the micro-break. To top it up, I provide two &amp;ldquo;monday mantras&amp;rdquo; to make your micro-breaks even more effective.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt, after lunch, that your mind cannot focus? or that, later on, writing suddenly feels effortless? If you have noticed trends in &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; these experiences happen, you have stumbled into the importance of chronobiology for your productivity. In this and following posts, I provide advice on how to organize your research work, based on chronobiology research. Today, circadian rhythms &amp;ndash; i.e., &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to do &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; during the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Have you ever gone out of a supposedly important meeting, after more than one hour of talking, but still feeling like a poor (or obvious) decision has been made? In this post, I go over a simple pattern to organize more effective meetings when a group decision or proposal has to be made. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by its simplicity: it&amp;rsquo;s much more effective than &amp;ldquo;business as usual&amp;rdquo; meetings, but people (including ourselves) will resist it fiercely, because it feels unnatural to act against our internalized meeting routines.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a PhD student, one sometimes gets the impression that holidays are something that happens only to other people, or that one does not deserve them (I’m so behind on so many things!). Yet, what does the research say about taking holidays, is it really good for you as a doctoral student? Are there better or worse ways of taking a vacation? As preparation for the blog’s own summer hiatus, this post goes over the benefits, pitfalls, and optimal dynamics of taking a longer break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasing restrictions on movement and other aspects of life, also come anxiety, fear and a strange sense of unreality. Doing anything related to your PhD seems unusually hard, or pointless… even dangerous, compared with being continuously in the lookout for the latest news or advice on what to do. In this post, I share a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/&#34;&gt;mantra&lt;/a&gt; and a few other tips that I use to help myself stay sane and (kinda) productive in these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Sleep</title>

      <guid>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/on-sleep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is your PhD giving you beautiful dreams or horrible nightmares? In either case, you probably should be getting more of them. Sleep (or, rather, lack of sleep) is one of the best-known and most consistent &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/risk-factors-phd/&#34;&gt;risk factors related to depression, anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and host of other mental and physical health issues. It is also one of the factors (mostly) under our control &amp;ndash; even if it often gets the back seat with respect to other priorities like work, social life, family, or the latest season of our favorite TV show. In this post, I review some of the (very extense, and rather terrifying) research about the effects that lack of sleep has on humans in general, and PhD students in particular. The post also points you to practices and resources to help you in sleeping not only longer, but also better. Keep your delicate mind and body machinery in optimal working condition!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we have seen the crucial role that having a sense of progress plays, not only in the productivity, but also in the engagement and persistence of a PhD student towards the doctorate. While this recognition (and the practices to &amp;ldquo;make progress visible&amp;rdquo; we saw) put a big emphasis on the student as the main active agent, PhD students are not the only actors in this play. Is there anything that doctoral &lt;em&gt;supervisors&lt;/em&gt; can do to help? In this post, I go over some of the same management research on progress and our own evidence from the field, looking at what supervisors can do to support their students in perceiving continuous progress that eventually leads to a finished doctoral thesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cultivating the progress loop in your PhD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like you are &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; in your PhD, making no progress, or going in circles? If so, you are in good company &amp;ndash; most PhD students report such experience at one time or another during their doctoral process. The normalcy of this experience, however, should not make us dismiss it as unimportant. In this post I review research that speaks to the importance of this sense of progress (or the lack of it) to our engagement with work and the eventual completion (or dropping out) of the PhD. The post also reviews several everyday practices to cultivate your own sense of progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to pay attention is one of the most important assets of a PhD student (or researcher) and plays a crucial role on our focus and productivity, but also on our creativity and wellbeing. In this month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I give you not one, but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; sentences that you can use to remind yourself to manage this resource wisely. Choose your favorite!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I proposed the use of your favorite calendar app to store all your TO-DOs and avoid over-committing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying this productivity trick on myself for the past few months. In this new kind of blog post, I report on the results of this self-experiment, and the effect it has had on my own productivity and wellbeing. I also provide some practical tips and tricks, in case you want to try it out for yourself. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/a&gt;: It works&amp;hellip; if you are a bit careful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the emphasis I have made so far in developing productive and healthy everyday routines (from &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;to-do lists&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/pomodoro-technique/&#34;&gt;pomodoros&lt;/a&gt;), not everything about productivity happens at this tactical, day-to-day level. In this short post, I guide you through what I think is the centerpiece of my own personal productivity system: the weekly review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt that you have too many threads open in your research work, and you cannot seem to make substantial progress in any of them? You are not alone. After closing the long series of posts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/happiness-in-the-lab-series/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;happiness in the lab&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, a bit of a lighter read this week. In this post I give very short advice that you can use as a &amp;ldquo;mantra&amp;rdquo; for this and the coming weeks, somewhat related to staying productive &amp;ndash; but with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As the first exercise in this format, I propose you use the best shortest productivity advice I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to deal with to-do list overwhelm</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/</link>

      <description>The to-do list is an essential staple of an organized, reliable doctoral student (or academic). Yet, have you ever looked at your task list and felt anxious, certain that you have too much to do and too little time? In this post, I review several routines that have helped me overcome this ubiquitous feeling.
I have been working (in the industry and in academia) for about twenty years now. Yet, periodically, I look at my to-do list, or at the list of “projects I’m doing”, and I feel my heart rate rise.</description>

      <title>Productivity tip: the Pomodoro technique</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/pomodoro-technique/</link>

      <guid>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/pomodoro-technique/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for many years.  I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, how to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
