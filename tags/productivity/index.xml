      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Ph.D. student you have plenty to keep track of: course sessions and deadlines, reading papers, writing papers, submitting papers, designing studies, gathering data, analyzing or reporting it&amp;hellip; As an advisor, you may remember with nostalgia the blissful time when you were a PhD and had only one research line. How can anyone stay on top of this insurmountable pile of deadlines and to-dos? It turns out, many people have faced this problem before, and have came up with systematic ways of solving it. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of these systems and variations (and I still experiment!). In this post, I will give you the gist of some of them, and the pros and cons that I have found by using them in real (academic) life. But, as they often say, &amp;ldquo;your mileage may vary&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for many years.  I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
