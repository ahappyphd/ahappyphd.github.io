      <title>Notes on chronobiology for the PhD (II): The science of breaks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being the &amp;ldquo;cognitive athletes&amp;rdquo; they are, PhD students (and researchers) should take &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; very seriously, to perform at their best. Yet, not all breaks are created equal: timing and other factors affect their effectiveness. Continuing previous dives into &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/chronobiology/&#34;&gt;chronobiology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/holidays/&#34;&gt;taking holidays&lt;/a&gt;, this post goes over evidence-based tips and tricks to make your breaks the most restorative and energizing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Monday Mantra to face uncomfortable emotions (#2 productivity challenge sneak peek)</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned that uncomfortable emotions (like guilt, anxiety or indecision) are one of the most common obstacles to productivity that our PhD students report. In preparation for a longer series of posts on &amp;ldquo;emotional first aid for the PhD&amp;rdquo;, I have found a short mental exercise that has helped me face those difficult emotions lately. Here it is, in the form of a card-based &amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Defusing task conflict in the PhD</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/task-conflict/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/productivity-challenges/&#34;&gt;in a recent post&lt;/a&gt;, “task conflict” is a common productivity challenge of doctoral students. As PhD students, we often have to juggle different identities, priorities, jobs, projects… along with doing the thesis itself. Yet, so often, it is the thesis-related tasks that keep getting pushed back. In this post, I will go over tips, practices and techniques that might be useful if you find yourself struggling with this particular challenge in your PhD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The three most common productivity challenges of PhD students</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel, during your PhD, that you are not “productive enough”? Guess what, you are not alone. In this post, I share the three most frequently-appearing productivity problems voiced in doctoral workshops we have run in Estonia and Spain. I hope this shows PhD students that they are not alone&amp;hellip; and gives PhD supervisors hints about the hurdles their students often face (whether they mention them explicitly or not). Also, I will give a couple of simple rules to know if these are a problem for you particularly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Micro-breaks and two Monday Mantras to supercharge them</title>

      <description>When we are writing a research paper, we need to find long stretches of focused time to get that writing done. Yet, even if we find them, can we really sustain intense focus during two or more hours? Today&amp;rsquo;s post looks at a research-backed and often overlooked tool in our productivity toolbox: the micro-break. To top it up, I provide two &amp;ldquo;monday mantras&amp;rdquo; to make your micro-breaks even more effective.</description>

      <title>Notes on chronobiology for the PhD (I): Circadian rhythms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt, after lunch, that your mind cannot focus? or that, later on, writing suddenly feels effortless? If you have noticed trends in &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; these experiences happen, you have stumbled into the importance of chronobiology for your productivity. In this and following posts, I provide advice on how to organize your research work, based on chronobiology research. Today, circadian rhythms &amp;ndash; i.e., &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to do &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; during the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More effective group decision-making meetings</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/meeting-pattern/</link>

      <description>Have you ever gone out of a supposedly important meeting, after more than one hour of talking, but still feeling like a poor (or obvious) decision has been made? In this post, I go over a simple pattern to organize more effective meetings when a group decision or proposal has to be made. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by its simplicity: it&amp;rsquo;s much more effective than &amp;ldquo;business as usual&amp;rdquo; meetings, but people (including ourselves) will resist it fiercely, because it feels unnatural to act against our internalized meeting routines.</description>

      <title>Take your holidays… the right way</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/holidays/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a PhD student, one sometimes gets the impression that holidays are something that happens only to other people, or that one does not deserve them (I’m so behind on so many things!). Yet, what does the research say about taking holidays, is it really good for you as a doctoral student? Are there better or worse ways of taking a vacation? As preparation for the blog’s own summer hiatus, this post goes over the benefits, pitfalls, and optimal dynamics of taking a longer break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Monday Mantra for times of coronavirus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasing restrictions on movement and other aspects of life, also come anxiety, fear and a strange sense of unreality. Doing anything related to your PhD seems unusually hard, or pointless… even dangerous, compared with being continuously in the lookout for the latest news or advice on what to do. In this post, I share a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/&#34;&gt;mantra&lt;/a&gt; and a few other tips that I use to help myself stay sane and (kinda) productive in these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Sleep</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/on-sleep/</link>

      <guid>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/on-sleep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is your PhD giving you beautiful dreams or horrible nightmares? In either case, you probably should be getting more of them. Sleep (or, rather, lack of sleep) is one of the best-known and most consistent &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/risk-factors-phd/&#34;&gt;risk factors related to depression, anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and host of other mental and physical health issues. It is also one of the factors (mostly) under our control &amp;ndash; even if it often gets the back seat with respect to other priorities like work, social life, family, or the latest season of our favorite TV show. In this post, I review some of the (very extense, and rather terrifying) research about the effects that lack of sleep has on humans in general, and PhD students in particular. The post also points you to practices and resources to help you in sleeping not only longer, but also better. Keep your delicate mind and body machinery in optimal working condition!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Advising for progress: tips for PhD supervisors</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/advising-progress/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we have seen the crucial role that having a sense of progress plays, not only in the productivity, but also in the engagement and persistence of a PhD student towards the doctorate. While this recognition (and the practices to &amp;ldquo;make progress visible&amp;rdquo; we saw) put a big emphasis on the student as the main active agent, PhD students are not the only actors in this play. Is there anything that doctoral &lt;em&gt;supervisors&lt;/em&gt; can do to help? In this post, I go over some of the same management research on progress and our own evidence from the field, looking at what supervisors can do to support their students in perceiving continuous progress that eventually leads to a finished doctoral thesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cultivating the progress loop in your PhD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like you are &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; in your PhD, making no progress, or going in circles? If so, you are in good company &amp;ndash; most PhD students report such experience at one time or another during their doctoral process. The normalcy of this experience, however, should not make us dismiss it as unimportant. In this post I review research that speaks to the importance of this sense of progress (or the lack of it) to our engagement with work and the eventual completion (or dropping out) of the PhD. The post also reviews several everyday practices to cultivate your own sense of progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to pay attention is one of the most important assets of a PhD student (or researcher) and plays a crucial role on our focus and productivity, but also on our creativity and wellbeing. In this month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I give you not one, but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; sentences that you can use to remind yourself to manage this resource wisely. Choose your favorite!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I proposed the use of your favorite calendar app to store all your TO-DOs and avoid over-committing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying this productivity trick on myself for the past few months. In this new kind of blog post, I report on the results of this self-experiment, and the effect it has had on my own productivity and wellbeing. I also provide some practical tips and tricks, in case you want to try it out for yourself. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/a&gt;: It works&amp;hellip; if you are a bit careful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the emphasis I have made so far in developing productive and healthy everyday routines (from &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;to-do lists&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/pomodoro-technique/&#34;&gt;pomodoros&lt;/a&gt;), not everything about productivity happens at this tactical, day-to-day level. In this short post, I guide you through what I think is the centerpiece of my own personal productivity system: the weekly review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt that you have too many threads open in your research work, and you cannot seem to make substantial progress in any of them? You are not alone. After closing the long series of posts on &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/happiness-in-the-lab-series/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;happiness in the lab&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, a bit of a lighter read this week. In this post I give very short advice that you can use as a &amp;ldquo;mantra&amp;rdquo; for this and the coming weeks, somewhat related to staying productive &amp;ndash; but with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A shorter post this week, to warn you about a small hiatus in the blog (due to taking a &amp;ldquo;disconnected break&amp;rdquo;), and to propose a new post format: Monday Mantras. As the first exercise in this format, I propose you use the best shortest productivity advice I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to deal with to-do list overwhelm</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/</link>

      <guid>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/</guid>
      <description>The to-do list is an essential staple of an organized, reliable doctoral student (or academic). Yet, have you ever looked at your task list and felt anxious, certain that you have too much to do and too little time? In this post, I review several routines that have helped me overcome this ubiquitous feeling.
I have been working (in the industry and in academia) for about twenty years now. Yet, periodically, I look at my to-do list, or at the list of “projects I’m doing”, and I feel my heart rate rise.</description>

      <title>Productivity tip: the Pomodoro technique</title>

      <guid>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/pomodoro-technique/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for many years.  I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, how to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
