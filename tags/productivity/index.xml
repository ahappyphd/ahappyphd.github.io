      <description>&lt;p&gt;A shorter post this week, to warn you about a small hiatus in the blog (due to taking a &amp;ldquo;disconnected break&amp;rdquo;), and to propose a new post format: Monday Mantras. As the first exercise in this format, I propose you use the best shortest productivity advice I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The to-do list is an essential staple of an organized, reliable doctoral student (or academic). Yet, have you ever looked at your task list and felt anxious, certain that you have too much to do and too little time? In this post, I review several routines that have helped me overcome this ubiquitous feeling.
I have been working (in the industry and in academia) for about twenty years now. Yet, periodically, I look at my to-do list, or at the list of “projects I’m doing”, and I feel my heart rate rise.</description>

      <title>Productivity tip: the Pomodoro technique</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for many years.  I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, how to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
