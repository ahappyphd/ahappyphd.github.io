      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Ph.D. student, you are very often asked to present what your research is about. You may have to do it very shortly in the archetypal &amp;ldquo;elevator pitch&amp;rdquo; to a visiting professor. Or whenever you have to give a talk at a conference or doctoral consortium. In this post, I go over a technique that the president of a large US research lab pointed me to. I will walk you through its simple four-part structure, including some real examples from my own work. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by its simplicity&amp;hellip; simplicity is its main strength!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sending papers to the wrong scientific venue is one of the most common causes for rejection I see every day. I choose my audience as one of the first steps in my process for writing papers. But, how do you do that exactly? Based on impact? Quality? Who&amp;rsquo;s the editor or chair? In this post, I go over steps and criteria that I use to find out where to send a particular piece of research work. Never go very far in the writing without a clear idea about this!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
