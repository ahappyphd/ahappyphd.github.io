      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the doctorate (and in our later lives as researchers) we have to deal with a wide variety of situations and tasks, some stressful, some requiring focus or calmness. Going to therapy, doing &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/avoidance/&#34;&gt;therapy-inspired reflection exercises&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/tags/journaling/&#34;&gt;journaling&lt;/a&gt;, and other practices are all very useful, but they require us to step &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from the difficult situation. If only there was a simple, free, portable tool to help us in such situations, something we could do in any occasion and which is evidence-based&amp;hellip; Wait, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;! This post is about &lt;strong&gt;breathwork&lt;/strong&gt;, an array of tools with an increasing body of scientific evidence demonstrating its effectiveness. The post describes how we should breathe for better health and cognitive performance, and how different kinds of breathing patterns can help us cope with common challenging situations throughout the PhD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
