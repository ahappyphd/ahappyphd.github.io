      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the blog we have written a lot about &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/tags/wellbeing/&#34;&gt;doctoral well-being&lt;/a&gt;, from different angles&amp;hellip; but what personal and contextual factors seem to affect it? A recent study out of Italy asked 216 students about this and about challenges to their well-being. In this post, we summarize the study and its findings, connecting these results with prior ideas in the blog, and how we can apply them in our own doctorate journey to find better well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quickie: How many PhD students are anxious or depressed (or will drop out) worldwide?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the catalysts that kickstarted this blog was the realization that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/&#34;&gt;PhD students are at a higher risk of mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; than other students and professionals. Yet, how bad is the problem really? Exactly how many PhD students are &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/am-i-normal/&#34;&gt;suffering&lt;/a&gt; from depression or severe anxiety &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;? How many will &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/drop-out-phd/&#34;&gt;drop out&lt;/a&gt;? In this quickie post, I pull from the data of a few recent studies to give a concrete, numeric &lt;del&gt;answer&lt;/del&gt; guesstimate to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Supporting different types of students to complete their PhD (Study report)</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/supporting-types-phd/</link>

      <description>Aside from PhD students&amp;rsquo; own motivational factors (e.g., how much progress they perceive, or how exhausted they are), the support they receive from supervisors is another key aspect related to doctoral completion. In the continuation of last week&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;study report&amp;rdquo;, we discuss how different kinds of supervisor support relate to those motivational factors and, eventually, the finishing of the doctorate. We will also see how supervisors could foster these motivational aspects and help their students complete the PhD.</description>

      <title>What kind of doctoral student are you? Motivational profiles and completing the PhD (Study report)</title>

      <description>Many factors seem to play out into whether we complete our PhD, or drop out of it. Some of them are external and largely uncontrollable (like financial or family problems), while others relate to our thesis project and motivation. In this new type of blog post (the &amp;ldquo;study report&amp;rdquo;), I dive into the results of a recent research study that defines five types of doctoral students, in terms of their motivational profile.</description>

      <title>Choosing not to drop out: a view from self-determination theory</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/choosing-not-drop-out/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/drop-out-phd/&#34;&gt;last week&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, we established that dropping out of a Ph.D. (or thinking about it) is surprisingly common, and we saw demographic and socio-economic factors that seem related to doctoral attrition. In this post, I dive into another strand of research that relates doctoral dropout with a general theory of human motivation: &lt;em&gt;self-determination theory&lt;/em&gt;. This research helps explain why you may persist and finish your doctorate (and even have fun doing it), despite having such socio-economic factors playing against you. Or vice-versa. The post also gleans practical advice from the literature on doctoral attrition, in the hope of helping students and supervisors avoid this common pitfall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who drops out of the Ph.D.?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that doing a Ph.D. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/&#34;&gt;seems to put you at a greater risk of being anxious or depressed&lt;/a&gt; than other occupations, some students may also face the question: will I ever finish my thesis &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;? This post digs into research about doctoral attrition and completion, and what factors seem to make dropping out more likely. Do not give up!&amp;hellip; unless you really want to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
