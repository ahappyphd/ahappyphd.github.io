      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT have been hailed as both a revolutionary resource and an apocalypse for education. Among graduate and doctoral students around me—and in my own everyday learning as a researcher—I see both futures playing out.

This post reminds us that the doctoral journey is a &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; journey and highlights a key aspect of any learning process, along with different ways we can engage in it. Then, I draw on research-based ideas to outline (tentative) principles for learning effectively with (or without) these AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
