Supervision style is one of the factors that seem to affect most PhD students&amp;rsquo; mental wellbeing. However, we tend to take it for granted, as just a small quirk of our environment.

I also share a few things you might try in order to make your student/supervisor relationship a bit less&amp;hellip; bumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
