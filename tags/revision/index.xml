      <description>&lt;p&gt;Along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/writing-papers-series/&#34;&gt;writing your first journal paper&lt;/a&gt;, doing a substantial revision to your manuscript upon receiving the reviewersâ€™ comments is one often-cited painful moment of any doctoral process. This complex act of scientific communication involves balancing diplomacy with integrity, creativity and systematicity. In this post, I go over the concrete (and, sometimes, counter-intuitive) steps I follow to revise my journal papers upon receiving peer-review critiques, as well as some basic principles to increase your chances of success and avoid unnecessary suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing research papers is one of the most dreaded (and most unavoidable) activities for many people during the PhD. In this series of posts I explore some of the reasons why writing research papers is difficult when one arrives at the PhD, and explain what concrete writing process I find myself following after more than a decade of academic writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
