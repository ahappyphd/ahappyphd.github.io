      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had this feeling, while writing, that your prose is leading nowhere? that right now it would be a great moment to defreeze the fridge? to check your phone, because someone may have texted? In this post, I offer a simple exercise to use next time these internal interruptions assail you during writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing research papers is one of the most dreaded (and most unavoidable) activities for many people during the PhD.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we present our research to others, in a conference or in writing, we often feel insecure: is what I found obvious? is there a fatal flaw in my reasoning or my data analysis? will the audience finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&#34;&gt;unmask me as the impostor I am&lt;/a&gt;? This week&amp;rsquo;s short &amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo; goes at the heart of such unproductive self-talk. What is all this really about?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
