      <description>&lt;p&gt;A doctorate is typically the first step in a longer (academic or otherwise) research career. Many think of it as a grueling rite of passage one must endure to get the job they want later on. But are there ways we can do the PhD to set us up for a remarkable and satisfying career? Are there ways we can make the PhD journey itself feel like a &amp;ldquo;good job&amp;rdquo;? In the first part of this book extract, we draw lessons from Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You&lt;/em&gt;, about &amp;ldquo;passion traps&amp;rdquo;, we look at properties of a good PhD job, focusing on mastery, control, and how to develop them for a more satisfying PhD (and beyond).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
