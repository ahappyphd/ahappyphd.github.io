      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a Ph.D. student and being happy sometimes feel like two incompatible states. We know of factors that affect your wellbeing, like your supervisor style or whether you have financial support. Yet, is there anything that you can actually do to make your worklife better, once the ball is rolling? In this post, I reuse research about &amp;ldquo;happiness at work&amp;rdquo; to propose actions and routines to help you cross the PhD desert with a (bigger) smile on your face.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Will you drop out of the PhD? or should you?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that doing a PhD seems to put you at a greater risk of being anxious or depressed, there is also the issue of whether you will finish your thesis at all. In this post I dig a bit into studies that look not only at the drop-out rates of PhD studies - also what factors and issues seem to make dropping out more likely. Do not give up&amp;hellip; unless you really want to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Risk factors for depression and anxiety in doing a Ph.D.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to the first post in this blog, I dig a little deeper in some of the research on anxiety and depression during doctoral studies, to find &amp;ldquo;risk factors&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;correlates&amp;rdquo; that seem to often come along these depressive symptoms. I hope that the awareness of these factors (from gender to things you can actually change in your everyday life) will help you understand why some people have tons of difficulty in doing a PhD, while for others it seems a piece of cake. And maybe also change what you do to put the odds on your side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The second reason why I write this blog</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/second-reason/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought that I was doing this to help the PhD students around me (and others like them elsewhere) to pass through the dissertation process more effectively, with less stress. But at some point, I realized that other, more selfish, reasons were playing out as well. In this personal account I reflect on a chronic problem of academics and Ph.D. students alike, and how I face it through this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is doing a Ph.D. bad... for your mental wellbeing?</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a growing body of research that indicates that doing a doctoral dissertation can be taxing on the mental health of PhD students, with depression, anxiety, or burnout all on the table. Is this problem real and, if so, how bad is it? In this post, I review several recent studies, some of which also offer insights about potential risk factors. This also kickstarts the whole idea of this blog, as a way to increase awareness about these difficulties, and offer practical tips and tricks to survive such a difficult period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
