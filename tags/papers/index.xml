      <title>Navigating authorship: a condensed crash course in setting authors for your paper</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Defining who are the authors of your scientific papers, while apparently trivial, is sometimes a surprisingly difficult decision (especially, the first times we do it). As novice researchers, we may operate under conjectures or assumptions about how scientific authorship works, which may not necessarily be true. In this post, I go over several factors that often weigh in into that decision, and I provide a couple of tips and resources about how I would go about taking that decision, ideally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I revise my journal papers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/writing-papers-series/&#34;&gt;writing your first journal paper&lt;/a&gt;, doing a substantial revision to your manuscript upon receiving the reviewersâ€™ comments is one often-cited painful moment of any doctoral process. This complex act of scientific communication involves balancing diplomacy with integrity, creativity and systematicity. In this post, I go over the concrete (and, sometimes, counter-intuitive) steps I follow to revise my journal papers upon receiving peer-review critiques, as well as some basic principles to increase your chances of success and avoid unnecessary suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Writing research papers series</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing research papers is one of the most dreaded (and most unavoidable) activities for many people during the PhD. In this series of posts I explore some of the reasons why writing research papers is difficult when one arrives at the PhD, and explain what concrete writing process I find myself following after more than a decade of academic writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Ten Commandments of scientific writing</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/10-commandments-writing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The writing of a paper (or the dissertation itself) is often a long process, along which many decisions are made: should I send my ideas for feedback now, or generate more polished text? should I think of the target journal now or decide once I have the finished draft? et cetera. To finish this mini-series of posts on writing (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/why-writing-is-hard/&#34;&gt;why writing papers is hard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/&#34;&gt;how I write papers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers2/&#34;&gt;the second part of that writing process&lt;/a&gt;), I review here the main principles and lessons that I have learned after more than 10 years of writing scientific papers. I hope they help you navigate these decisions if you are in doubt, or if you have to step out of the usual writing process due to unexpected events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I write papers (Part 2)</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing a paper is one of the hardest, but most creative parts of a Ph.D. Very often, we do not know where to start, what to do at what point, or when to get feedback from our collaborators. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I started describing in detail the process I normally follow to write my scientific papers. This post explains the rest of the process, from the outlining until you send your manuscript off to the journal/conference. One would think that this is straightforward, just &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejv2_CkZRHo&#34;&gt;scribbling and scribbling&lt;/a&gt;, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I write papers</title>
      <link>http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of advice out there on how to write academic publications, from general stylistic tips to field-specific guides. Yet, I&amp;rsquo;ve found most of that advice tends to be abstract, or focused on the final product, never giving you a step-by-step account of the process. In this post, I share the writing process I find myself using after 70+ academic publications. This will give you an idea of where to start writing your paper (especially if you have never written one), and it will show you that all polished papers have humble (even crappy) origins. Kill perfectionism, and the dreaded &amp;ldquo;academic writer&amp;rsquo;s block&amp;rdquo; will eventually disappear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
