      <description>&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of research as rational, mechanistic, sterile, orderly. However, there are many things about research that are random, chaotic, and require loads of creativity (&lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/writing-papers-series/&#34;&gt;writing papers&lt;/a&gt; being only one example among many).

In this month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, I give you not one, but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; sentences that you can use to remind yourself to manage this resource wisely. Choose your favorite!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
