      <title>Reviewing doctoral well-being research (study report)</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/review-wellbeing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doctoral well-being is &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/tags/wellbeing/&#34;&gt;one of the central topics in this blog&lt;/a&gt; (indeed, it was the one that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/&#34;&gt;started it all&lt;/a&gt;, more than three years ago). While I have tried to base my writings in the peer-reviewed research of this area, so far my reading of it has been rather unsystematic. How do doctoral well-being researchers summarize this body of knowledge? In this post, I distill from the findings of a systematic literature review on doctoral well-being, teasing out topics and factors that we already knew about from previous posts as well as novel ones that we can try to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Avoiding avoidance and other mental self-sabotage in the PhD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does the thesis bring you a sense of anxiety, fear or discomfort? As we saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/am-i-normal/&#34;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, that is not an uncommon experience at certain points during the PhD. At the heart of many of our unsuccessful strategies to deal with these symptoms (including distraction and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/addiction/&#34;&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;) is the notion of avoidance. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explain what avoidance is, its key role in many mental health afflictions, and suggest exercises and strategies to help us overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Monday Mantra to face uncomfortable emotions (#2 productivity challenge sneak peek)</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned that uncomfortable emotions (like guilt, anxiety or indecision) are one of the most common obstacles to productivity that our PhD students report. In preparation for a longer series of posts on &amp;ldquo;emotional first aid for the PhD&amp;rdquo;, I have found a short mental exercise that has helped me face those difficult emotions lately. Here it is, in the form of a card-based &amp;ldquo;Monday Mantra&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Am I normal? An intro to mental health in the doctorate</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/am-i-normal/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By now, we have established that PhD students (and academics in general) &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/&#34;&gt;seem to be at a higher risk to develop mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; like depression or chronic stress. But, how can we know if &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; have one of these mental health problems, right here, right now? In this post, co-authored with colleague, friend and therapist Paula Odriozola-Gonz√°lez, we go over a few basic concepts of psychopathology, and propose criteria and simple practices to help separate internal experiences that we all go through at one time or another, from the more serious stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
