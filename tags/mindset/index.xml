      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed by your endless to-do list? Stressed because of the many PhD-related tasks you need to &amp;ldquo;go through&amp;rdquo;? As &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;we discussed previously in the blog&lt;/a&gt;, you are not alone (and ask any already-doctors whether this feeling goes away after graduation). Lately, as I struggle with not-so-new-parenthood-unproductivity in my own research, I have been reminded several times of a mental reframe I first encountered in productivity writer &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oliverburkeman.com/&#34;&gt;Oliver Burkeman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s work. This simple metaphor helped me change my relationship with my to-do list, without hurting my productivity (more probably, the opposite).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
