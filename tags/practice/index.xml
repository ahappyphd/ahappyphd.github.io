      <title>A PhD So Good It Can&#39;t Be Ignored (II) -- Mission, a System, and a Case Study (book extract)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have now established that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/phd-so-good-1/&#34;&gt;a PhD provides plenty of opportunity&lt;/a&gt; to develop mastery and (in many cases) autonomy. Yet, these properties alone do not always ensure a remarkable and satisfying research career. In this second part of the book extract from Newport’s &lt;em&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/em&gt;, we look at an additional piece in the puzzle—having a &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo;—and summarize the book’s system of practices to develop both mastery and mission, which can be applied directly during the PhD. I conclude with some critiques of the book and a case study to test whether these ideas map to my own research career thus far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A PhD So Good It Can&#39;t Be Ignored -- Passion, Practice, and Control (book extract)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A doctorate is typically the first step in a longer (academic or otherwise) research career. Many think of it as a grueling rite of passage one must endure to get the job they want later on. But are there ways we can do the PhD to set us up for a remarkable and satisfying career? Are there ways we can make the PhD journey itself feel like a &amp;ldquo;good job&amp;rdquo;? In the first part of this book extract, we draw lessons from Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You&lt;/em&gt;, about &amp;ldquo;passion traps&amp;rdquo;, we look at properties of a good PhD job, focusing on mastery, control, and how to develop them for a more satisfying PhD (and beyond).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tiny idea: To-do lists are menus</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/tiny-menus/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed by your endless to-do list? Stressed because of the many PhD-related tasks you need to &amp;ldquo;go through&amp;rdquo;? As &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;we discussed previously in the blog&lt;/a&gt;, you are not alone (and ask any already-doctors whether this feeling goes away after graduation). Lately, as I struggle with not-so-new-parenthood-unproductivity in my own research, I have been reminded several times of a mental reframe I first encountered in productivity writer &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oliverburkeman.com/&#34;&gt;Oliver Burkeman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s work. This simple metaphor helped me change my relationship with my to-do list, without hurting my productivity (more probably, the opposite).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We often come up with complicated and costly schemes to improve our lives (buy that new gadget, watch that new show everyone is talking about), when simpler zero-cost solutions may have better chances of actually having a positive impact. In another tiny post, I share a quick tip on how to enhance your lab/work-life by using natural spaces. &lt;em&gt;This idea will also be familiar to long-time &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/newsletter/&#34;&gt;newsletter subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, as it was an early &amp;ldquo;newsletter exclusive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
