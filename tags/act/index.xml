      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does the thesis bring you a sense of anxiety, fear or discomfort? As we saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/am-i-normal/&#34;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, that is not an uncommon experience at certain points during the PhD. At the heart of many of our unsuccessful strategies to deal with these symptoms (including distraction and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/addiction/&#34;&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;) is the notion of avoidance. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explain what avoidance is, its key role in many mental health afflictions, and suggest exercises and strategies to help us overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
