      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you start your workday full of energy and eager to tackle your research but find yourself by mid-morning already spent and demoralized? Does this happen after a flurry of email interactions, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/social-media-addiction/&#34;&gt;social media scrolling&lt;/a&gt;, or passive meetings?

This post will go over a (still half-baked) idea about how different kinds of work energize us, and simple rules that we can implement for a more sustained sense of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/&#34;&gt;progress&lt;/a&gt; and satisfaction with our (PhD or otherwise) work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
