      <description>&lt;p&gt;In previous posts, we have seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/chronobiology/&#34;&gt;how chronotype can influence our productivity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/chrono-breaks/&#34;&gt;how we can tweak our breaks&lt;/a&gt; to make the most of the ebbs and flows of our daily energy. But, how exactly can we use this chronobiology knowledge to craft a daily routine that is both productive and healthy, and fitting to our particular situation? In this post, I borrow from the habits and routines of an expert on the topic (Stanford neurobiologist Andrew Huberman) ten easy protocols you can put in practice to make every day your best day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Notes on chronobiology for the PhD (II): The science of breaks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being the &amp;ldquo;cognitive athletes&amp;rdquo; they are, PhD students (and researchers) should take &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; very seriously, to perform at their best. Yet, not all breaks are created equal: timing and other factors affect their effectiveness. Continuing previous dives into &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/chronobiology/&#34;&gt;chronobiology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ahappyphd.org/posts/holidays/&#34;&gt;taking holidays&lt;/a&gt;, this post goes over evidence-based tips and tricks to make your breaks the most restorative and energizing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>When we are writing a research paper, we need to find long stretches of focused time to get that writing done. Yet, even if we find them, can we really sustain intense focus during two or more hours? Today&amp;rsquo;s post looks at a research-backed and often overlooked tool in our productivity toolbox: the micro-break. To top it up, I provide two &amp;ldquo;monday mantras&amp;rdquo; to make your micro-breaks even more effective.</description>

      <title>Notes on chronobiology for the PhD (I): Circadian rhythms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt, after lunch, that your mind cannot focus? or that, later on, writing suddenly feels effortless? If you have noticed trends in &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; these experiences happen, you have stumbled into the importance of chronobiology for your productivity. In this and following posts, I provide advice on how to organize your research work, based on chronobiology research. Today, circadian rhythms &amp;ndash; i.e., &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to do &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; during the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
