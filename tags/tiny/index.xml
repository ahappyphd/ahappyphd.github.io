      <title>Tiny idea: To-do lists are menus</title>
      <link>https://ahappyphd.org/posts/tiny-menus/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed by your endless to-do list? Stressed because of the many PhD-related tasks you need to &amp;ldquo;go through&amp;rdquo;? As &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/&#34;&gt;we discussed previously in the blog&lt;/a&gt;, you are not alone (and ask any already-doctors whether this feeling goes away after graduation). Lately, as I struggle with not-so-new-parenthood-unproductivity in my own research, I have been reminded several times of a mental reframe I first encountered in productivity writer &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oliverburkeman.com/&#34;&gt;Oliver Burkeman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s work. This simple metaphor helped me change my relationship with my to-do list, without hurting my productivity (more probably, the opposite).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Have you ever spent an hour scrolling on Instagram (or your ​social media addiction of choice​) and later realized with a pang of regret that such a time could have been spent much better doing something else you deeply ​value​? This sort of realization is at the core of this week&amp;rsquo;s blog post: a tiny practice to guide our daily decision making about what to do next. This idea will also be familiar to long-time newsletter subscribers, as it was an early “newsletter exclusive”.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We often come up with complicated and costly schemes to improve our lives (buy that new gadget, watch that new show everyone is talking about), when simpler zero-cost solutions may have better chances of actually having a positive impact. In another tiny post, I share a quick tip on how to enhance your lab/work-life by using natural spaces. &lt;em&gt;This idea will also be familiar to long-time &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/newsletter/&#34;&gt;newsletter subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, as it was an early &amp;ldquo;newsletter exclusive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our efforts to fix our life&amp;rsquo;s problems, we often keep adding stuff to our lives and ideas to our theses, ignoring there&amp;rsquo;s an alternative. In another tiny post, I quickly share how you can harness the power of subtraction. &lt;em&gt;This idea will be familiar to long-time &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/newsletter/&#34;&gt;newsletter subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, as it was an early &amp;ldquo;newsletter exclusive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
