      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the blog we have written a lot about &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/tags/wellbeing/&#34;&gt;doctoral well-being&lt;/a&gt;, from different angles&amp;hellip; but what personal and contextual factors seem to affect it? A recent study out of Italy asked 216 students about this and about challenges to their well-being. In this post, we summarize the study and its findings, connecting these results with prior ideas in the blog, and how we can apply them in our own doctorate journey to find better well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
