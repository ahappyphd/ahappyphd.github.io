      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Ph.D. student, you are very often asked to present what your research is about. You may have to do it very shortly in the archetypal &amp;ldquo;elevator pitch&amp;rdquo; to a visiting professor. Or whenever you have to give a talk at a conference or doctoral consortium. In this post, I go over a technique that the president of a large US research lab pointed me to. I will walk you through its simple four-part structure, including some real examples from my own work. Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by its simplicity&amp;hellip; simplicity is its main strength!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By far, this is the tool (as in, &amp;ldquo;thinking tool&amp;rdquo;) which I recommend most often to PhD students. This diagram summarizes your main research questions, thesis contributions and evidence of their usefulness. While painful to make, this brutal synthesis exercise is also a powerful communication tool. In this post, I explain how it works, its origins, and how making 18+ versions of it helped me through my PhD. Copy the provided template and use it in your PhD supervision meetings or even in the PhD defense!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
