      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like the prose of your papers is burdensome and rambling, even after lots of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/&#34;&gt;outlining and feedback&lt;/a&gt;? Do you often get feedback from co-authors about it being ambiguous, aimless or vague? Do you keep making the same writing mistakes again and again? The final step in drafting a paper (generating final prose &lt;em&gt;and editing it&lt;/em&gt; sentence-by-sentence for clarity) is laborious and often overlooked. In this short post, I point you to a set of proofreading/editing tips from another blog, and share with you one tip to help you detect those pesky errors and make your prose more punchy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
