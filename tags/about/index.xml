      <description>About A Happy PhD Are you doing a doctoral dissertation and feeling a bit lost, or unworthy, or just not knowing where to start, how to order your ideas and work effectively? Do you feel like everyone else is finding their path &amp;ldquo;naturally&amp;rdquo;, but you don&amp;rsquo;t?
Are you supervising doctoral students, but feel like you are basically &amp;ldquo;improvising&amp;rdquo;, or following whatever behaviors your advisors applied with you, and wonder why nobody teaches you how to do this, why there is no handbook on how to give effective advice?</description>
