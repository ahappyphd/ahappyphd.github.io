[{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been using for many years. I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, how to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!\nIt is 8:00am. The apartment is quiet and in semi-darkness (the winter sun still hasn\u0026rsquo;t gone up). I put my phone in silent mode, and keep it away from sight. As I sit down to start writing this blog post, I go to my browser and click on the small tomato icon, which turns red, signaling that I have nothing else to do in the next 25 minutes, but write.\nWhat I just described may be quite familiar to some of you: it was me using \u0026ldquo;the pomodoro technique\u0026rdquo;. If somebody asked me which one productivity technique or lifehack I would take to a desert island with me for the rest of my life, it would be this one. By far.\nBut wait, wasn\u0026rsquo;t this blog about PhD students and depression stuff? Well, yes and no. In fact, once people are depressed, probably what they need is a therapist/specialist (not a blogger) to help them out of it. Here, I focus more on the preventive side: how to keep yourself effective and happy so that you finish the PhD and enjoy the ride as much as possible. Once I started looking at the current science of happiness (or \u0026ldquo;positive psychology\u0026rdquo;, as they call it), it seems that having a sense of self-efficacy (read, being and feeling productive) seems to play a large role in it1. So no, not all posts will be depressing - and yes, productivity tips, tricks and routines will feature here from time to time.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s get back to the Pomodoro\u0026hellip;\nA bit of history The Pomodoro Technique \u0026reg; (yes, apparently it is a registered brand) is generally attributed to Francesco Cirillo, who developed it in the 1980s, as a university student looking for \u0026ldquo;a way to get more done in less time\u0026rdquo;. Since then, it has become a very popular \u0026ldquo;lifehack\u0026rdquo;, and now there is an entire book by Cirillo about it2, training courses and certifications, etc. In any case, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t build your whole work life around it, it is a nice little trick to know, and something you can adopt in your own life, right now.\nThis technique is very often used by knowledge workers in many industries, from software development to design, and I know for a fact that many researchers (no matter whether they are early PhD students or seasoned professors) swear by it when they try to stay productive. Oh, and where does the name come from? basically, from the Italian for \u0026ldquo;tomato\u0026rdquo; - Cirillo used a kitchen timer with the shape of a tomato, when he first developed the technique in university.\nHow to do it In case you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go to down to Cirillo\u0026rsquo;s official page (or any of the other dozens of websites and blog posts already describing it), here is a very brief primer on how to start \u0026ldquo;pomodoring\u0026rdquo;, right now:\n Choose a task you want to get done (works especially well for tasks you alone can do, which you\u0026rsquo;ve been procrastinating on). Put away all distractions, especially your phone (which should be put in flight or silent mode) but also email notifications in your computer and other known interruption sources. Make an oath to yourself to work on this task (and only this task) for 25 minutes without interruption. Then, set an actual timer for 25 minutes (some people like physical kitchen timers, but small computer apps also work). Work on the task for the alloted 25 minutes without interruption. Come on, it\u0026rsquo;s just 25 minutes, you can do it! When the timer rings, make a mark on a piece of paper3 and take a break (typically, 5 minutes). Well done! Take a minute to congratulate yourself for advancing in that long-procrastinated task. I\u0026rsquo;m serious. Then, breath, get off your chair, drink a glass of water, stretch, meditate, whatever. That\u0026rsquo;s it!4  Did you do it? How did it feel? Let me know in the comments.\nThe science behind the tomato Despite the technique being mentioned in every other book and article about productivity and graduate students5, there is surprisingly little scientific literature about its use and effectiveness. Aside from several case studies of how it was adopted by different software development firms6, the only real studies I found trying to see if this technique really worked for people was in the field of human-computer interaction, where people design apps to facilitate the practice of the pomodoro, and then evaluate the app (not the method per se). One such study7, about an app that blocks distracting sites in your phone and computer, found that people that used the app did more pomodoros, and felt less stress (the authors argue that it is because you off-load the responsibility of keeping yourself on task to the app). But all these studies tend to be quite small-scale and exploratory.\nOf course, there are plenty of conjectures out there (by Cirillo and others) about why the technique works: because it helps you re-frame time as an event you use to achieve something, instead of a resource you are running out of; the fact that it matches the human attention and focus span; its emphasis on taking breaks periodically (which we too often ignore); etc. But, in the end, it seems that most people supporting it out there, do so out of personal experience. That is also why I recommend it myself: it has worked for me. My guess is that, if you are not a procrastinator, you always get your things done in time and effortlessly\u0026hellip; then, this is not for you. But if you feel overwhelmed by your to-do list (or you don\u0026rsquo;t have a to-do list!) and tend to distract yourself too easily from the important stuff, maybe trying this for a week can change your life forever.\nCaveats As I said, the Pomodoro has been one of my central productivity tricks for many years, and it has helped me greatly when I find myself procrastinating or overwhelmed by obligations at work. However, that does not mean that I use it absolutely all the time. As noted in the Pomodoro booklet and in some criticisms to the technique, there are times when avoiding the Pomodoro is probably a good idea:\n Do not use it when you know you will be interrupted. If you are in your office hours and students are probably coming to see you, or when you are in meetings or your work requires intense teamwork, then it is probably better to not do pomodoros (as it will likely be frustrating to handle what you will see as interruptions). Thankfully, some of the activities in a Ph.D. are solitary almost by definition (e.g., reading, writing your own research), so you will have plenty of opportunity to use the little tomato! Do not use it in your free time. This may seem obvious, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been guilty of trying this myself. As we will see in later posts, resting and unscheduled free time are an essential activity that should be preserved (in the same way sleep is an important part of an athlete\u0026rsquo;s training). Making pomodoros out of leisure activities (e.g., reading a novel for fun) makes them goal-oriented, and will suck the fun out of them very quickly.  Personal experience, tips and tricks In the many years I have been using the Pomodoro technique, I have come across several realizations, tips and tricks about it:\n The timer: When I first discovered the technique, I went out and bought a physical kitchen timer. There was a certain enjoyment in the physicality of setting the timer and hearing the soft tic-tac, but I very soon discovered that not everyone found it as soothing as I did (nor the loud ring at the end!). Since most of my working life occurs within (or nearby) a web browser, I used this nifty little website for a while, and now I use the Marinara Chrome extension. If those options do not fit your particular situation, just pick whatever is easy to call up within your daily routines and workflow (you can Google around for \u0026lsquo;pomodoro timer\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;pomodoro app\u0026rsquo;). I do not recommend using a phone app (the device is often too full of notifications and other potential distractions to outweigh the benefit of the pomodoro). The space: I\u0026rsquo;ve found that how you implement the pomodoro is not as important as where you do it. Choose carefully a space where you are quite sure that no one will interrupt you, and that you will not interrupt or distract yourself. This often rules out your own office, or your kitchen (if you are prone to fridge trips). My personal favorite as of today is the library at our university, as it is close by, it\u0026rsquo;s quite silent, has comfortable chairs/desks, and probably no one is looking for me there8. The distractions. I cannot emphasize this enough: turn off email notifications, and any other notification in your computer (if you are going to work at the computer). And do yourself a favor and put away the phone - really away, as in \u0026ldquo;off your sight, in another room\u0026rdquo; away9. Unless you are expecting a call from the hospital where your grandma is hospitalized, this alone is a productivity tip in itself: once I removed all notifications in my computer (and most of the ones in the phone), my productivity, capacity for attention and general happiness improved markedly. Multi-pomodoro chunks. This is already built-in if you follow Cirillo\u0026rsquo;s full Pomodoro methodology as described in the book. But even if you don\u0026rsquo;t: there is a benefit to doing, say, 4 or 6 pomodoros in a row. There is only so much you can do in 25 minutes, and for really difficult, analytical or creative tasks, a single pomodoro just gets you started. Hence, set aside 2-3 hours for these important, hard tasks, and do several pomodoros in a row, focused on the same task (still taking breaks, but not starting a different task). Peak stress use: I use the technique most intensely (and reap the most benefits from) when facing \u0026ldquo;peak stress\u0026rdquo; moments. Sometimes you have a hard, complex deadline coming close (e.g., when preparing an experiment, when writing a paper or a funding proposal you cannot postpone), and you realize there are still 10-20 different things you need to do in only a few days. In these cases, I just make a list of the tasks, decide their importance, dependencies and sequence, and then budget a number of pomodoros (up to the number of pomodoros I can realistically do in the few remaining days) to each of them. Then, I commit to doing the best I can in the very limited time allotted to each task, but no more (a use of the Pareto principle - you often can get 80% of the results with the first 20% of your efforts). The results are not perfect (tip: they never are), but they are much better than the alternative - an even lousier job due to not sleeping at all, or total breakdown and failing to meet the deadline at all. Effects on mood: Although I only have subjective, anecdotal evidence of this, I have observed that the days when I manage to use this technique more consistently, seem to correlate with more intense feelings of effectiveness and accomplishment. In general, not only more stuff gets done, I\u0026rsquo;m just in a better mood throughout the day! Collective pomodoros: This one is mentioned in Wang et al.\u0026rsquo;s paper6, and I know of Ph.D. students that work in the same office that have used it. Basically, a co-located group of people agrees certain stretches of time to synchronize and do pomodoros together (even if everyone works on their own thing). This social variant of the pomodoro has several intuitive advantages, like reducing interruptions from your co-workers, and allowing for nicer breaks in which you can socialize with your office mates, feel less awkward stretching, etc. In a sense, this is similar to a \u0026ldquo;Shut up and write\u0026rdquo;, to which I will probably dedicate a separate entry in the future.  Just do it. Now. This post just scratched the surface of what the Pomodoro technique can do for you10. If you have read so far and you have not done a pomodoro yet, now it is the time to do so. Go back to the step number 1 above, choose the most important and difficult thing you have to do today, and do a pomodoro. Just one. Just now.\nA small notification appears in the lower right corner of the screen: take a small break. I look at my screen: the text is still convoluted and long, far from perfect, but not too bad for only 25 minutes of work11. As I get up and stretch my arms over my head, I revel in the feeling of having created something (even if it is an incomplete, imperfect something). It was worth the time.\n Ryan, R.

[return] There are also earlier, probably shorter versions of the book also floating around on the \u0026lsquo;Net, like this one. [return] This is basically to record (to celebrate!) that you completed one pomodoro. If you get distracted or interrupt yourself to do something else, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to make this mark. If you do more pomodoros about the same task, or about other tasks during the day, this alone can be a primitive way of measuring your productivity. [return] There is an additional step, which I consider optional: If you are doing multiple \u0026ldquo;pomodoros\u0026rdquo; in a row, take a longer break (say, 15 minutes) after four of them. Take a walk around the building, go chat with somebody, do some burpees\u0026hellip; do not spend this longer break doing email! (I\u0026rsquo;m often guilty of this one, but then it is not a break) [return] See, for example, Lackey, A. E., Moshiri, M., Pandey, T., Lall, C., Lalwani, N., \u0026amp; Bhargava, P. (2014).

[return] The pomodoro is also a quite popular strategy in the software industry, among companies adhering to \u0026ldquo;agile methodologies\u0026rdquo; for making software.

[return] As the software development community has found out, the Pomodoro also has other uses such as estimating and tracking your work, dealing with interruptions efficiently, and many more (go read the book if you\u0026rsquo;re interested). [return] In case you are wondering how fast I write, writing this post took about nine pomodoros, not counting the time I spent reading studies and doing research about the technique.

This diagram summarizes your main research questions, thesis contributions and evidence of their usefulness. While painful to make, this brutal synthesis exercise is also a powerful communication tool. In this post, I explain how it works, its origins, and how making 18+ versions of it helped me through my PhD. Copy the provided template and use it in your PhD supervision meetings or even in the PhD defense!\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s too hard\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m blank\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what to put there\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;It keeps changing all the time\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard almost every kind of complaint about this tool. However, I still have to find a Ph.D. student that tells me that doing it was useless. It is hard to summarize years of hard work (past and future) into a single page but, as many creative writers will tell you1, being able to distill the most important ideas of a 400-page book into a single page, leads to a clarity of ideas that is often lacking.\nThis is the first of a series of posts on \u0026ldquo;PhD tools\u0026rdquo;: structures, conceptual frameworks or actual hardware/software tools that I (and others) have found useful to advance the Ph.D. dissertation, across different fields. There is lots of general advice out there on how to do diagrams (e.g., for your literature review papers), but not so many that are directly useful for defining the thesis itself. Of course, there are too many research fields and traditions out there, so this particular structure may not fit your particular situation. But I suggest you give it a go - you may be surprised!\nOrigins I first came across this thinking tool when doing my own Ph.D. at GSIC-EMIC, a inter-disciplinary educational technologies lab at the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Back there, it was common advice to fill up one such diagram, once your thesis topic was more or less defined2. Spending an hour diagramming quickly made you realize that things were not as clear as you initially thought, and that your research contributions had more holes than a piece Gruyère cheese\u0026hellip;\nI originally thought that this was just a common researcher device in use everywhere, pretty much like Ellis\u0026rsquo;s problem-goal-question schema0. However, my later travels around different labs have convinced me that this kind of exercise is not common at all (which is why I think this post can be useful). Thus, the diagram is a truly \u0026ldquo;home-brewed\u0026rdquo; thing3, which evolved in an iterative manner since its first (partial) appearance in Asensio-Pérez\u0026rsquo;s thesis0, throughout several other theses45, my own thesis6 and beyond7. We all modified it slightly to fit our particular needs. And we all agree that it was a very useful device to define, understand and communicate our own research.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s hope it helps you too.\nWhat it is As you can see in the thesis references above, the diagram is commonly used in the introduction section of a dissertation, and it is meant to introduce, in graphical form, some of its main elements: the research Context, main research Question, Objectives, Contributions of your thesis and their Evaluation. However, many of us have also used it way before starting to write the dissertation book itself, as a \u0026ldquo;guiding star\u0026rdquo; when discussing with others and planning the thesis work. Below you can see an generic example of such a diagram8. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at each of the elements that make it up:\n\r\r\rA generic CQOCE diagram\n\r\r\r Context. As in, \u0026ldquo;research context\u0026rdquo;. This box is meant to convey where your research sits within the scientific community or communities that are close to what you do. At the beginning of your Ph.D., this box may contain just the name of 1-2 research fields, and/or very general topics within them that interest you. However, as you read more and more literature and understand your field and what is interesting for you, it can become quite specific (see the examples from my own thesis below). Generally, it is also very important to lay out here what is the main problem that you have detected in current research, the \u0026ldquo;hole\u0026rdquo; in the current state-of-the-art that your thesis intends to \u0026ldquo;plug\u0026rdquo;. This basically gives the why of your thesis: what is wrong with our current knowledge of the world, that your thesis tries to make right? Research Question. Probably one of the most obnoxious habits of old professors that one meets randomly during the Ph.D., is to ask: \u0026ldquo;Oh, so you are a doctoral student here\u0026hellip; and what is your research question?\u0026rdquo;. This often leads to the student answering evasively and trying to scurry away. Aside from its obnoxiousness, this question has another interesting property: it is very good at signaling the maturity of a student. If you are able to understand that you are here to further human knowledge, you have identified clearly something that is not known, and formulated it in a single sentence that is actually a question and can be answered with data in a reasonable amount of time, you are almost 50% of the way there (yet another reason why making this diagram is useful). This main research question is probably the element of the diagram that changes most often throughout the Ph.D., normally in the direction from \u0026ldquo;very general, almost impossible to answer even with unlimited funds and manpower\u0026rdquo;, to \u0026ldquo;very specific and convoluted, but with some chance of being answered by a single person in a few years\u0026rdquo;. Objectives: This box tries to answer the question of how would you go about finding out the answer to your research question above. However, it is not really a plan yet: rather, it tries to \u0026ldquo;decompose\u0026rdquo; your research question into more manageable elements, either conceptually (for instance, looking independently into different concepts/keywords that appear in your main research question) or temporally (dealing with A is needed before trying to investigate B). Contributions: This is probably the trickiest element of the diagram to fill in, and the one which I get most questions about. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do a separate post on the whole \u0026ldquo;What counts as a research contribution?\u0026rdquo; question, but here goes the two-sentence version: It is whatever previously unknown, reusable knowledge that you propose or produce during your research, which materializes the answer to your research question. The main problem is that what counts as valid knowledge depends a lot on your research field - which is why you need more experienced peers (like your supervisor, or reading papers from other people in your field), to guide you in defining this. For instance, in many fields (especially, applied ones), a research contribution has to be: a) novel (nobody has done the same or a very similar thing); b) feasible (it can be done practically, it is not just some futuristic fantasy); and c) useful (something that solves an important, relevant problem for some stakeholder). Another tip: very often (but not always), contributions are linked to the different objectives you laid out in the previous box (e.g., each objective is materialized in a contribution that fulfills the objective). Evaluation: Once you have decided what your contribution(s) is/are, you only need to prove that it works as you say it does, e.g., that it is novel, feasible and useful. In many fields, this involves gathering data of some kind from the world, using whatever means at your disposal (from huge radio-telescopes to asking a single person in an interview). This box thus tries to represent graphically how the different data gathering events that you organize, provide this proof for the value of the different contributions you define, to meet the objectives and finally answer the research question of your thesis (see the over-complex examples from my thesis in the figure below).  If all this sounds terribly abstract and vague to you, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you are in good company (everyone thinks so at the beginning). Hopefully, an example will help bring some clarity\u0026hellip; but then again, maybe not, if you are in a field very far away from mine. Therefore, take the example if it helps you, but do not consider it the only way of doing this!\nHow I used it during my Ph.D. Going through my archives from the thesis period, I have found at least 18 different versions of this diagram (hence, not counting those I quickly drew on paper and never made it into my hard drive). Below, you can see three examples spanning the three years that my Ph.D. work lasted: a first one from about six months into the actual Ph.D. work (hand-drawn on the left, mostly in Spanish), another one from around the middle, and the final one that appeared on my dissertation (on the right).\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rCQOCE diagrams for my own thesis, from the beginning of my thesis work (left), mid-way through it (center) and at the defense (right)\n\r\r\rA lot can be said about those particular diagrams (parts of them still make me cringe), but there are three take-aways I want to leave you with: a) your diagram should probably look much simpler than mine (my thesis was too complicated, for reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t need to discuss here); b) it is OK to hand-draw yours (it is often quicker, and has the same communication power); and c) as you can see in the middle one, it is OK to have incomplete or doubtful parts in it. That is the whole point of the diagram: to identify what parts we are unsure of, or have no idea how to deal with, and see how the conception of our own dissertation is changing over time.\nFast-forward six years, and I still use this kind of diagrams when starting a new research line, especially if it is a collaboration with other researchers, and I have to communicate what the main idea and elements of the research are. Which leads me to\u0026hellip;\nWhy use it - and when not to There are several reasons why you might want to give this exercise a go (or recommend it to your students, if you are an advisor):\n It is a useful reflection exercise: In the day-to-day life of a Ph.D. there are so many different tasks, reading papers, planning experiments, gathering data, doing analysis, writing your own papers\u0026hellip; It is very easy for each of these to become a rabbit hole we pursue. Sometimes these meanderings are useful and prompt a permanent change in how you think about your thesis (they become central to it). Sometimes they are just unnecessary distractions. This exercise forces you to stop for a moment 9, and think deeply, and make your current ideas about what you are doing (and why) visible. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ever show it to anybody else, knowing your direction (or even whether there are gaps in your ideas) feels tremendously empowering. As a reminder and prioritization tool. Once you have a version of the diagram in place (even with holes or question marks in it), you can print it and keep it somewhere visible in your office or workspace. And every time you are analyzing data, or reading an interesting paper, or writing your own, or coming up with ideas for cool experiments, you can look at it and think: does it fit or relate with my main problem? is it central or peripheral to it? does it further my contributions? And depending on what your answer is, you can give it a clear priority compared with your other tasks and ideas (or reject it completely\u0026hellip; until you finish the Ph.D. at least). Or you can quickly draw a new box in the diagram, if you think it is really important. Although the two values above are very important, I think the real killer application of this diagram is as a communication tool: It summarizes, in a single page, what the most important question and ideas of your thesis are, and what you are trying to achieve. It also forces you to decide what the right keywords and terminology to use (something different scientific communities are known to be quite picky about) - and elicit problems with the words you use, once you present it to others. You can use it in your meetings with the Ph.D. advisor (to front-load your topic in your advisor\u0026rsquo;s exhausted/busy brain), in the introduction to any of your thesis reports (to get the reader to understand how this piece fits in the whole puzzle of your work), whenever you have to write for a \u0026ldquo;doctoral consortium\u0026rdquo; or other kind of short presentation about your doctoral work, \u0026hellip; heck, you can put it even in your Ph.D. defense presentation10!  However, not everything about this exercise is great, and there are several circumstances where I would not necessarily recommend to use this:\n If you know for a fact that your advisor (or whatever audience you plan to use it with) dislikes diagrams. \u0026ldquo;Diagrams discourage deep thought and argumentation\u0026rdquo; - I have gotten this remark sometimes from very respected academics, and maybe they have a point. The diagram is not a substitute for a thoughtful, well-argued text (or conversation) describing where your research question comes from and what your contributions are. It is rather a complement - even if it is a very useful one! If you feel that making it is taking too long, or you are endlessly nitpicking about terminology, or you are putting off other important tasks in your Ph.D. to do this (i.e., the diagram has become an act of procrastination). Aside from fully focusing on it when you do it, I also recommend to \u0026ldquo;timebox\u0026rdquo; it11. Remember, this is a tool best used in iteration and communication: rather do a half-baked one in one hour and discuss it with somebody, than spend a whole week on it and end up unsure of whether it is the perfect version (tip: it never is). If you and everyone involved is crystal clear on what the topic is, or you have your topic and contributions well described somewhere else in relatively short form (e.g., in your initial Ph.D. research plan) - provided that nothing much has changed in your ideas described there. If you want to highlight the research methodology you use (a glaring omission in the current version of the diagram) or other kinds of temporal structure or tasks/plans in your Ph.D.. There are other representations more adequate for that kind of thing, like Gantt charts or other task-flow diagrams (I also used some of those in my thesis - maybe a topic for a future post?). If you\u0026rsquo;re not taking the exercise seriously or you think it is utterly useless. But this is a general rule: never do anything you think is meaningless, if you can avoid it :)  Try it out\u0026hellip; and let me know how it goes That\u0026rsquo;s it. I hope this small tool is useful for you in progressing towards a complete dissertation. Now, this diagram is most useful if you actually go and do it. Get off your seat, go for a walk, then sit down again for one or two hours (with your phone in flight mode). Paint it with colored pencils, hand-draw it in the back of the proverbial napkin, use your computer, whatever. Bonus points if you then share it with your advisor or a colleague or anyone.\nJust do it \u0026ndash; and let me know how it goes in the comments.\nAlso, do you have other diagrams or thinking tools that helped you greatly in advancing in your PhD? let me know in the comments below - I\u0026rsquo;ll be glad to share other tools like this in the future.\n See, for example, this post by Jason Fried. [return] Contrary to other universities/faculties, in that field and university it is common to start the Ph.D. with a vaguely-defined research topic and questions. In other places, an initial Ph.D. proposal already has to have a quite clear research question, methodology and research plan behind it (at least, on paper).

Is this problem real and, if so, how bad is it? In this post, I review several recent studies, some of which also offer insights about potential risk factors. This also kickstarts the whole idea of this blog, as a way to increase awareness about these difficulties, and offer practical tips and tricks to survive such a difficult period.\nThe other day I encountered a colleague at the university. When I first met her, more than two years ago, she seemed a very active, positive person, with an iron will and lots of initiative, a true go-getter. Now, when I talked to her, she still smiled, but a light inquiry into how things were going quickly revealed her many struggles, from unhelpful supervisors to problems with some of the software she has to use on a daily basis. Subsequent times we\u0026rsquo;ve met recently have led to similar exchanges: \u0026ldquo;everything is a problem\u0026rdquo;, is one of her most frequent sentences now.\nOf course, many things may have happened for this person to change her attitude so starkly, but there is one thing I know for sure about her: she has been doing a PhD for the last two years. And I have been around PhD students long enough now, in different labs and different countries (including my own PhD) to know that this is not an isolated case. Interestingly, when I was a knowledge worker in the industry, such emotional downturns were relatively uncommon, so\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s going on here?\nWell, doing a PhD is hard. Anyone will tell you that, from the university professor, to the baker whose cousin is a lab rat. However, we often understand that as: oh, you have to be really smart to do it. But maybe it is not the smarts (or lack thereof) that makes it difficult.\nI recently crossed this problem again in the generalist press, and apparently this topic appears in the news from time to time. It just seems to be largely ignored, or thought to be \u0026ldquo;the way things are\u0026rdquo;. But the first link above referenced a couple of concrete, recent research studies, so I decided to start digging\u0026hellip; is there more to this than my subjective perceptions?\nWhat the some research says Apparently, some researchers must be getting worried about this, because I found quite a few interesting studies done in the last couple of years. For instance, a recent study on more than 2,000 graduate students from 26 countries1 found that about 39% of them had moderate or severe depression symptoms (and 41% of them had moderate/severe anxiety symptoms). This does not mean much (who is not depressed these days with all the fake news and stuff?) until you read that the prevalence of depression symptoms in the general population is less than 6%2! Another study done in Belgium last year3 found similar rates of mental health symptoms (30%-50% depending on the severity) in more than 3,600 PhD students. There, they also do a comparison to understand how high that is: the prevalence of the same symptoms in \u0026ldquo;highly educated\u0026rdquo; general population is around 14%-27% 4. In a study in Brazil, about 21% seemed to be the prevalence of major depression symptoms in graduate students 5. Going a bit back in time, and to other countries, we find different numbers: 8.9% (France, 2010 6), 27% (Turkey, 2008 7), 13% (US, 2007 8), or 5% (Brazil again, in 1995 9)\u0026hellip; It is interesting how data varies quite a lot from country to country (but also for the general population, symptoms for depression in Brazil are 22% in the latest study, vs. the 6% of Germany), and over time (in the Brazilian 1995 study they mention a general population prevalence of 2%!). On top of that, other factors can be at play, like selection bias (not all studies are from cross-sectional or representative samples).\nThe studies also point out some factors that seem to correlate with such symptoms: gender, having children or a partner, perceived work-life balance, or quality of the student\u0026rsquo;s supervision. Some of these vary from study to study, but many seem to be common. There is quite a lot to be said about this topic of what seems to correlate with depression in doctorate students, so I will cover that separately in an upcoming post.\nConclusion Then, the question remains: are you at a greater risk of depression if you do a PhD? It seems that it depends a lot on where you are in the world: in a country where people may have already other reasons for depression generally (like Brazil?), the number is quite close to the general population; but in a relatively \u0026ldquo;happy\u0026rdquo; country like Germany, the chances of being depressed seems to multiply by 5 or more if you are a PhD student!\nIn absolute terms, across studies, the most recent numbers seem to be that around 25-50% of students show moderate or severe depression symptoms. That\u0026rsquo;s one in four, up to one in every two students! Certainly something to watch out for.\nIn practice - a call to action And how is this useful, what can you do now that you know this?\n If you are a PhD student and you\u0026rsquo;re feeling a bit down (and chances are you have felt this in the past, or will in the future), at least know that you are not alone. This is not to say: \u0026ldquo;yeah, this is normal, so buckle up and go on\u0026rdquo;. Mental wellbeing is just as important as physical health (but we talk much less about it, and it is a well-known taboo in many societies). If we start coughing and feeling dizzy, we try to self-diagnose (e.g., with a thermometer), and if it seems serious, we go to the doctor. Well, there are questionnaires like the PHQ-9 (used in many of the studies above), which you can take in order to get an idea of how bad it is. At the very least, talk to somebody, anybody you trust - and if it\u0026rsquo;s bad, go to your doctor, or an specialist! If you are friends or family with a PhD student, you can just keep a friendly eye on them, check in with them from time to time, maybe point them to this blog if you think this information can be useful for them. And if they mention many of the symptoms that appear in these self-tests, maybe suggest them to self-diagnose or see a doctor. If you are a supervisor, you can periodically interest yourself in your students\u0026rsquo; morale and again suggest self-diagnosis or seeing a doctor if you think something is going on. If you think all this talk of depression is nonsense (\u0026ldquo;nobody cared about my depression when I did my PhD!\u0026ldquo;), think again: will anyone benefit if your student drops out (or worse) tomorrow? Your research won\u0026rsquo;t, for sure. In a later post I will also write about the whole students dropping out issue. If you are considering to do a PhD, think about this carefully, and consider yourself warned. True, thousands of people do PhDs successfully every year, but that does not mean there is no suffering on the way; a PhD can also be one of the happiest, most fulfilling episodes of your life (at least mine was so for the most part). Just be aware of the risks (see a later post for more about the risk factors and correlates). Be prepared. For me, personally, as a novice PhD supervisor, this has motivated me to learn more about these mental wellbeing issues, and other techniques and tools to help my students be more productive and (why not) happier during the PhD. I want to be prepared to help others. I will be documenting my discoveries in this blog, and I hope you will find them useful.

Do you feel like everyone else is finding their path \u0026ldquo;naturally\u0026rdquo;, but you don\u0026rsquo;t?\nAre you supervising doctoral students, but feel like you are basically \u0026ldquo;improvising\u0026rdquo;, or following whatever behaviors your advisors applied with you, and wonder why nobody teaches you how to do this, why there is no handbook on how to give effective advice? (hint: there are handbooks, but they may not be what you think).\nThen, A Happy PhD may be interesting for you. Here I will share actionable, practical tips and tools that I (and others) have found useful about the art (?) of becoming a researcher and helping others do so.\nI will try to look at problems and situations that many PhD students face, which are not field-specific: from productivity to wellbeing, from conceptualizing your research to writing it up or going to scientific conferences. As much as possible, I will look at what actual research is there on the subject, and propose tips, tricks and tools that may help navigate these situations.\nHowever, do not expect the formal, measured, academic tone of a peer-reviewed publication. This is a blog, not a scientific journal. I hope it will feel more like a conversation with a colleague in a bar, about the everyday problems and solutions that we encounter as we learn to do science and help each other to do it better.\nI hope this blog also becomes a catalyst to create awareness about these seldom-mentioned problems and situations. A place for people to come and talk about these issues, to pose problems, ask questions, suggest solutions, or tips or tools to cover.\nIt is going to be an exciting journey.\nAbout me I am a relatively recent doctor, starting to supervise my own PhD students. Despite my arguably short scientific career, I am amazed at the variety of supervision styles and workplace dynamics that I have seen in different fields and labs, and the wild variety of doctoral student experiences resulting from it \u0026ndash; many of which are not very productive or healthy. I have the impression we are selling our students short, just because we were sold short ourselves.\nI am also surprised to find that many of my more experienced colleagues seem to face the same hurdles and issues that I find, and shrug defeatedly when I ask for solutions. Much of the written advice I\u0026rsquo;ve found on supervision was either too abstract, or too specific to one field or a particular situation or institution. I wonder if there are not patterns, practices, solutions that people have found as they do this for decades and decades. I have found a few that worked for myself and people I know, and I will share them here.\nIn summary, I am just a beginner on this. I hope to learn a lot by investigating and writing about this, and I will be glad to have you come along.\nDisclaimer The advice in this blog (especially when I write about delicate issues like mental health and depression) is not a substitute for a experienced researcher in a particular field, or a professional therapist. However, whenever possible I will point to research or self-diagnose tools that may help you determine whether you need more expert advice.\n","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/about/","tags":["About"],"title":"About"}]
