[{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"After a long hiatus for personal reasons, we are back in business! Continuing from our last post from 2021, here I highlight one of the blog\u0026rsquo;s big foci for this starting year: the \u0026ldquo;big PhD questions\u0026rdquo;. The post goes over what Google has to say about this (!) and asks for your ideas and opinions on what big questions about the doctorate we should investigate next at the \u0026ldquo;A Happy PhD\u0026rdquo; blog.\nPause! The latest post in this blog was published at the end of October 2021. You might be wondering what has happened for the past three months. Had I died? Got tired of writing this blog, or disinterested by the topics of doctoral productivity, wellbeing and supervision?\nNone of them. Nothing further from the truth.\nSuffice to say I had to take a long break for personal reasons \u0026ndash; a happy event, mind you, and one that prompted a lot of reflection. I hope you will pardon this (unannounced) interruption, and that you are all well, healthy and full of energy to finish your dissertation (or to help others finish it).\nSo am I!\nFor 2022 we are going to try different kinds of posts: interviews with insights from doctoral education experts, supervisors and, yes, doctoral students themselves; distilling practical lessons for the PhD from selected books (so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to read them \u0026ndash; I know you are all a busy bunch!). And, we will focus on solving the big question marks of any doctoral journey\u0026hellip;\nWhat other BIG PhD Questions do you have? In the previous post I delved into the big question that prompts all the other problems and satisfactions that we have talked about in this blog: \u0026ldquo;Should I do a PhD?\u0026rdquo;. I am aware many of you are already past that question and well in the middle of doing your PhD, facing other big, challenging dilemmas and questions (on top of your dissertation\u0026rsquo;s research questions, that is!).\nYet, doctoral students being so different, and doctoral journeys being so varied, it is hard for me to grasp which questions loom large in your minds, keeping you awake at night. In an effort to go beyond my own experience and see what is in people\u0026rsquo;s minds, I turned to\u0026hellip; Google Autocomplete.\nYes, you read that right. That nifty dropdown in Google Search that uses algorithms to try and guess what your query is, to save you a few seconds of typing. It is an interesting tool to investigate the zeitgeist of a topic, and there are even games that use it as a central device. I just typed \u0026ldquo;is my PhD\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;are PhDs\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;my PhD\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and similar sentence beginnings, and observed what suggestions came up. Those are probably what most people are searching for. Some of the results were hilarious (\u0026ldquo;my PhD is in dance\u0026rdquo;), and others were frankly disturbing (\u0026ldquo;my PhD is killing me\u0026rdquo;).\nI encourage you to try it as well\u0026hellip; You will probably get different results from mine, as Google customizes the results to your geographical location and other things it knows about you. But the real point of this post is not what Google thinks people is looking for.\nThe point is: what are YOUR big PhD questions?\nBelow, you can find a poll with a few of my own ideas and the most interesting ones that came up with the aid of Google. Please provide below your own ideas for BIG questions we should investigate in the blog (with the \u0026ldquo;Add new idea\u0026rdquo; button), and vote for the questions you would most like to see answered (with the \u0026ldquo;Vote\u0026rdquo; buttons). You have about one week, until Saturday, February 5, 2022, to answer!\nNB: In case you cannot see the poll embedded below, you can also access it here\r. Sorry for the technical gimmick! :)\n\rThanks a lot for keeping on reading the blog, I truly appreciate every visit and every idea.\nUpdate (11 Feb 2022): As you can see above, several interesting \u0026ldquo;big PhD questions\u0026rdquo; came up in the poll: How can I fund my PhD? How to focus my PhD topic? Should I quit my PhD? How to network in my PhD? Thanks to everyone that contributed! The most popular big PhD question was: \u0026ldquo;Is my PhD advisor a phycho?\u0026quot; We cannot generalize given the size and un-scientificness of the poll, but it is both interesting, and very sad. I\u0026rsquo;ll start working on a post on this right away. Do you have any pointers or stories about psycho (or just a$$hole or unhelpful) advisors? Send them to ahappyphd.blog@gmail.com.\nHeader image by mohamed_hassan from PxHere.\n","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/more-questions/","tags":["Question","Dilemma","Research","Life"],"title":"A hiatus... and more BIG PhD questions"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"If you are reading this, chances are that you have already decided to do a PhD. Yet, you may know someone who is considering a doctoral degree (or you may be offering such a position as a supervisor to prospective students). This post is for them. In this new type of post, we will look at big questions facing any PhD student. Today, we analyze the question that precedes all the other big PhD questions: \u0026ldquo;should I do a PhD?\u0026rdquo;. Below, I offer a couple of quick, simple ways to look at this important life decision, and a list of 10 factors to consider when offered (or seeking) a PhD position.\nThe other day, some researcher colleagues told me about a brilliant master student of theirs, to whom they were offering the possibility of doing a PhD in their lab. However, the student was doubtful: should she embark on this long and uncertain journey, on a low income, foregoing higher salaries (and maybe more stability) if she entered the job market right away? Her family and friends, not really knowing what a PhD or academia are like, were also giving all sorts of (sometimes contradictory) advice. Should she do a PhD?\nThis simple question is not asked nearly as much (or as seriously) as it should. Many people (myself included!) have embarked on this challenging, marathon-like experience without a clear idea of why it is the right choice for them, for that particular moment in their lives. Given this lack of clarity, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised by the high rates of people that drop out of doctoral programs, or that develop mental health issues, once they hit the hard parts of the journey.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s approach this big PhD question from a few different angles\u0026hellip;\nA first short answer: Thinking about the career path When I started my PhD back in 2007, coming from a job in the industry, I only had a very nebulous idea that I might like to do research professionally (albeit, to be honest, what I liked most about research was the travelling and the working with foreign, smart people). My employer back then was encouraging us to earn doctoral degrees as a way to pump up the R\u0026amp;D output. Thus I started a PhD, without a clear idea of a topic, of who would be my supervisor, or what I would do with my life once I had the doctoral degree in my hands.\nThis is exactly what some career advice experts like Cal Newport say you should NOT do. They argue that graduate degrees (also including Master\u0026rsquo;s) should not be pursued due to a generic idea that having them will improve our \u0026ldquo;job prospects\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;hirability\u0026rdquo;, that it will help us \u0026ldquo;land a job\u0026rdquo; more easily. Rather, they propose to take a cold, hard look to what we want to do after the doctorate (do I want to be a Professor? if so, where? do I want a job in the industry? in which company? etc.). Then, pursue the PhD only if we have proof that a PhD, from the kind of university program we can get into1, is a necessary requisite for that job.\nIf you aspire to be an academic (and maybe get tenure), do not take that aspiration lightly: such positions are becoming increasingly rare and competition for them is fiercer than ever. Take a look at the latest academic positions in your field at your target university, and who filled them. Do you have a (more or less) similar profile? In some highly prestigious institutions, you need to be some kind of \u0026ldquo;superstar\u0026rdquo; student, coming from a particular kind of university, if you want to get that kind of job.\nIn general, I agree with Cal that we should not generically assume that a PhD will be useful or get us a job in a particular area, unless we have hard evidence on that (especially if we want a job in the industry!). Also, I agree that the opportunity cost of a PhD should not be underestimated: if you enroll in a PhD program, you will probably be in for a reduction in salary (compared with most industry jobs), for a period of four or more years!\nYet, for some of us, the plan about what to do after the PhD may not be so clear (as it was my case back in 2007). Also, being too single-minded about what our future career path should look like has its own problems2. Indeed, there are plenty of examples of people that started a PhD without a clear endgame in mind, who finished it happily and went on to become successful academics or researchers. Ask any researcher you know!\nSo, if this first answer to \u0026lsquo;should I do a PhD?' did not give us a clear answer, maybe we need a different approach. Read on.\nA longer answer: Factors for a happy (or less sucky) PhD If we are still unsure of whether doing a PhD is a good idea, we can do worse than to follow the decision-making advice I have proposed in a previous post for big decisions during the PhD. In those posts, I describe a three-step process in which we 1) expand our understanding of the options available (not just to do or not do a PhD, but also what PhD places are available, what are our non-PhD alternative paths, etc.); 2) analyze (and maybe prototype) and visualize the different options; and 3) take the decision and move on with it.\nHowever, one obstacle we may face when applying that process to this particular decision is the \u0026ldquo;analytic intuition\u0026rdquo; step, in which we evaluate explicitly different aspects of each of the options, to inform our final, intuitive (i.e., \u0026ldquo;gut feeling\u0026rdquo;) decision. If we have never done a PhD or been in academia, we may be baffled about what are the most important aspects to consider when making such an evaluation about a particular PhD position, or whether a PhD is a good path for us at all.\nBelow, I outline ten factors that I have observed are related to better, happier (but not necessarily stress-free!) PhD processes and outcomes. Contrary to many other posts in this blog (where I focus on the factors that we have control over), most of the items below are factors outside our direct control as PhD students, or which are hard to change all by ourselves. Things like our current life situation, what kind of person we are, or the particular supervisor/lab/topic where we would do the PhD. Such external or hard-to-change aspects are often the ones that produce most frustration (and probably lead to bad mental health or dropout outcomes) once we are on the PhD journey:\n Time. This is pretty obvious, but often overlooked. Do we have time in our days to actually do a PhD (or can we make enough time by stopping other things we currently do)? PhD programs are calibrated to take 3-4 years to complete, working at least 8 hours a day. And the sheer amount of hours spent working on thesis materials seems to be the most noticeable predictor of everyday progress in the PhD, according to (still unpublished) studies we are doing of doctoral student diaries and self-tracking (and, let\u0026rsquo;s remember, progress itself is the most important factor in completing a PhD3). And there is also the issue of our mental energy: if we think that we can solve the kind of cognitively demanding tasks that a PhD entails, after 8 hours of an unrelated (and potentially stressful) day job, maybe we should think again. Abandon the idea that you can do a PhD (and actually enjoy it) while juggling two other day jobs and taking care of small kids. Paraphrasing one of my mentors, \u0026ldquo;a PhD is not a hobby\u0026rdquo;, it is a full-time job! Ignore this advice at your own risk. Money. This is related to the previous one (since time is money, as they say), but deserves independent evaluation. How are we going to support ourselves economically during the 3+ years that a PhD lasts? In many countries, there exist PhD positions that pay a salary (if we can get access to those). Is that salary high enough to support us (and maybe our family, depending on our situation) during those years? If we do not have access to these paid PhD positions (or the salary is too low for our needs), how will we be supported? Do we have enough savings to keep us going for the length of the PhD? can our spouse or our family support us? If we plan on taking/keeping an unrelated job for such economic support, read again point #1. Also, consider the obligations that a particular paid PhD position has: sometimes it requires us to work on a particular research project (which may or may not be related to our PhD topic), sometimes it requires us to teach at the university (which does not help us advance in our dissertation), etc. As stated in the decision process advice, it is important to talk to people currently in that kind of position or situation, to see how they actually spend their time (e.g., are they so stressed by the teaching load that they do not have time to advance in the dissertation?). Having social support (especially, outside academia). This one is also quite obvious, but bears mentioning anyways. Having strong social ties is one of the most important correlates of good mental health in the doctorate, and probably also helps us across the rough patches of the PhD journey towards completion. Having a supportive spouse, family, or close friends to whom we can turn when things are bad, or with whom we can go on holidays or simply unwind and disconnect from our PhD work from time to time, will be invaluable. Even having kids is associated with lower risk of mental health symptoms during the doctorate (which is somewhat counter-intuitive, and probably depends on whether you have access to childcare or not). A PhD can be a very lonely job sometimes, and there is plenty of research showing that loneliness is bad for our mental and physical health! An attitude of learning. Although this is a somewhat squishy factor, it is probably the first that came to my mind, stemming from my own (anecdotal, non-scientific) observation of PhD students in different labs and universities. Those that were excited to learn new things, to read the latest papers on a topic, to try a new methodology, seem to be more successful at doing the PhD (and look happier to me). People that are strong in curiosity seem a good match for a scientific career, which is in the end about answering questions (even if curiosity also has its downsides). This personal quality can also be related to Dweck\u0026rsquo;s growth mindset (the belief that our intelligence and talents are not fixed and can be learned)4. If you are curious, this mindset can be measured in a variety of ways. A knack for systematicity and concentration. This one is, in a sense, the counterweight to the previous one. Curious people often have shorter attention spans, so sometimes they (we, I should say) have trouble concentrating or focusing on the same thing for a long period of time. Yet, research is all about following a particular method in a systematic and consistent way, and often requires long periods of focus and concentration. Thus, if we find ourselves having trouble with staying with one task, idea or project for more than a few minutes in a row, we may be in for trouble. The PhD requires to pursue a single idea for years! Valuing autonomy. As I mentioned in passing above, a PhD is, by definition, an individual achievement (even if a lot of research today requires teamwork and collaboration). Thus, to be successful (and even enjoy) the process of the PhD, we have to be comfortable being and working alone, at least for some of the time. Spending years developing our own contribution to knowledge that no one else has come up with before, should not feel like a weird notion to us. Even if it occasionally comes with the uncomfortable uncertainty of not knowing whether our ideas will work out. In human values research they call this impulse to define our own direction, autonomy5, and many of my researcher friends tell me it is a very common trait in researchers. However, these values are very personal and very cultural. To evaluate this factor, we could simply ask ourselves how much we value this autonomy over other things in life, or use validated instruments to measure relative value importance, like the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ). Liking and/or being good at writing. I have written quite a bit here about the importance (and difficulty) of writing in the PhD. Be it writing journal and conference papers, or the dissertation tome itself, every PhD student spends quite a bit of time writing, as a way of conveying new knowledge in a clear, concise and systematic way. Learning to write effectively is also known to be one of the common difficulties of many PhD processes6, due to reasons discussed elsewhere. Hence, if we hate writing, we should think carefully about spending the next 3+ years doing something that necessarily involves quite a bit of writing, other people spotting flaws in your writing, and rewriting your ideas multiple times. Please note that I don\u0026rsquo;t consider being a good (academic or nonfiction) writer a necessary requisite for a PhD, as it can be learned like any other skill (again, the learning attitude in point #4 will help with that!). But being good at it will certainly make things easier and will let you focus on the content of the research, rather than on learning this new, complex skill. Your supervisor(s). Rivers of ink have been spilled over how important the role of the supervisor(s) is for a successful PhD6,7. Although most doctoral programs have mechanisms for changing supervisors after the start of a doctorate, it is not an easy change and can significantly delay its finishing. The choice of PhD supervisor can thus be the target of its own decision process (if you can choose with whom to work for your dissertation). A non-exhaustive list of aspects I would evaluate in order to choose a supervisor includes:  Compatibility (or, as they call it in the literature sometimes, the \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo;) of our and their personalities, ways of working (e.g., do they like micro-managing people, but you hate people looking over your shoulder?) and expectations about what a doctoral student and a supervisor should do. A concern for you as a person. Since this is difficult to evaluate as we may not know each other yet, we could use their concern about the people that work in their lab (beyond being just a source of cheap labor), as a proxy. Enthusiasm for the field of research or topic, its importance in the world, etc. A cynic, jaded researcher may not be the best person to guide us to be a great member of the scientific community. A supervisor that is well-known, an expert in the particular topic of the dissertation. Looking at the number of citations, e.g., in Google Scholar is a good initial indicator, but look at the publication titles (are they in similar topics to those they are offering you as your doctoral project? if not, that may mean that this person may also be new to your particular dissertation topic!). Related to the previous one, does this researcher have a good network of (international) contacts in other institutions? Do they frequently co-author papers with researchers in other labs/countries? We may be able to benefit from such contact network, and get wind of important opportunities during the dissertation and for our long-term research career. Openness (and time!) to talk about what the doctoral student job entails, potential barriers and difficulties, etc. This can be a proxy to both their general busyness (you will not get much guidance if they can never meet you because they have too little time) and their communication skills (something critical to consider when signing up to work closely with someone for years). Whether the supervisor is an ethical person. This is very important but seldom considered (maybe because it is hard to evaluate!). For sure, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to be backstabbed or exploited by our supervisor! Whether this person(s) is known to be a good supervisor. Have they already supervised other doctoral students to completion, in nominal time and with good grades? Do they regularly attend trainings and professional development about doctoral supervision? Do they seem to care about this part of their job for its own sake (rather than as a mere medium to get cheap labor)? You may be wondering how you are going to gather information about all the aspects mentioned above. Sometimes you can ask the supervisor directly, but you can also talk with current PhD students of this person, or students in the same lab/department (but do not take what they say at face value: partisanship, gossip or rivalries may be at work!). If you have the time and the opportunity, try to \u0026ldquo;prototype\u0026rdquo; (see the decision process post) the experience of working with this supervisor: do a master thesis with them, or a summer internship, or use the work on a joint PhD project proposal (a pre-requisite before being accepted as a doctoral student in some institutions). Some things we don\u0026rsquo;t know we like until we try them! Of course, all of the above are two-way streets. As prospective students, we also need to show to a potential supervisor that we are open to talk about expectations, that we are somewhat flexible, dependable, etc. Be very conscious of this in your interactions with supervisors and other people in their lab!   The lab/department where you will do the dissertation. Again, there are many things to consider here. Is there an actual research group, or will we be doing our research in isolation with our supervisor? Normally, the former is preferable, since that gives us more resources to draw from if the supervisor is not available. Is the research group well known in the field (again, look at citations, invited talks, etc. of different group members)? But especially, try to get an idea of the lab\u0026rsquo;s working atmosphere: is it stressful, relaxed, collaborative, competitive\u0026hellip;? As with the previous point, we could prototype it by spending some time working there, or we can interview one or more people working in the lab. If we do the latter, it is better to go beyond direct questions that will give vague (and maybe unreliable) answers, like \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s good\u0026rdquo;. Rather, take a journalistic approach, and ask people to narrate concretely what the routines are in the lab, when and how did they last collaborate with another student, or the last conflict arising in the lab. Then, decide whether this kind of ambience is a good fit for you. The concrete PhD topic. We should find out (e.g., from our prospective supervisor) whether the topic of the dissertation is already well-defined, or rather we will have to explore and define it ourselves (both options have pros and cons, and again it depends whether we value more autonomy and exploration, or having a clear path ahead). Is the area or keywords of the PhD topic going up or down in popularity (see here for a potential way to find out)? Are there clear funding schemes that specifically target this kind of research topic, at the national or international level? How easy is it to collect evidence for this kind of research (empirical data is a critical element in almost all research fields, so we want easy and reliable access to them)? I would not evaluate a PhD topic on the basis of whether we love it right now, as we never know much about any research area when we start a doctorate (even if we think we do!). An attitude of learning and curiosity (see #4) will take care of that. Rather, talk with the supervisor about how the research process might look like, what kind of activities will take up most of our time (reading papers? doing labwork? interviewing people?): do we find those activities interesting?  Yet, after considering all these 10 factors separately, we may not be clear on the decision (maybe some aspects are good, others not so much). If, after all this thinking and gathering of information we still are not sure, there is one last idea I can offer\u0026hellip;\nOne last answer: We cannot really know (the PhD as a transformative experience) We could also frame the question of whether to do a PhD as what philosopher L.A. Paul calls a \u0026ldquo;transformative experience\u0026rdquo;8. Doing a PhD is a big life decision (like becoming a parent or taking a powerful drug) through which we probably will transform ourselves into another person, with different preferences and even different values.\nI can think of many ways in which I am a different person now, due to the transformative experience of doing my PhD: I am now able to read and understand scientific papers (e.g., when I come across a new idea or \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo;, I go and read actual research papers about that), and I can evaluate the reliability of different types of evidence; I trust more scientific advances and consensus; I am more comfortable speaking (and writing) in English; I am more aware of culture and life in other countries, and I have less chauvinistic views of foreigners (due to my international experience gained as a researcher). Et cetera.\nPaul\u0026rsquo;s argument regarding transformative experiences is that there are limitations to simulating (i.e., imagining) whether we will like the experience, as our own values and preferences may be changed by the very experience we try to simulate. For similar reasons, there are limits to the usefulness of asking others about the decision (and trusting their testimony), since they also have different values, preferences and coping strategies than us. Even looking at the latest and most reliable research on the topic (e.g., whether PhD students end up happier and/or more satisfied with their lives than people who did not take that choice) is of limited help, since such research (of which there is little!) often concentrates on average effects, and we may not be \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat to do, then?\nL.A. Paul\u0026rsquo;s way out of this dilemma seems to be a reframe of the question: \u0026quot;Will I be happier if I do a Ph?\u0026ldquo;, \u0026quot;Should I do a PhD?\u0026ldquo;. Rather, we can ask: \u0026ldquo;Do I value discovering my new self as a researcher/doctor?\u0026quot;. In a sense, this new question targets a key intrinsic value we may (or may not) have: Do we appreciate learning, exploring, getting novel experiences, discovering and remaking ourselves (related to point #4 above)? If yes, a PhD might be a good idea. If we prefer stability, things (and our life) as they have always been, the status quo\u0026hellip; maybe we will not appreciate this transformation that much.\nThere is no right or wrong answer. Only your answer.\nThe diagram below summarizes the main ideas in this post. Reflect upon these questions, and make your own choice. Take responsibility for your choice\u0026hellip; but don\u0026rsquo;t blame yourself for the outcome, i.e., if it does not work out as you expected. There are too many inherent uncertainties about this decision that cannot be known until we actually walk the path.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSummary of the ideas in this post\n\r\r\rDid these arguments and factors help you think through the decision of doing (or not doing) a PhD?

Yet, how bad is the problem really? Exactly how many PhD students are suffering from depression or severe anxiety right now? How many will drop out? In this quickie post, I pull from the data of a few recent studies to give a concrete, numeric answer guesstimate to these questions.\nFor the past two years, we have been writing in this blog about the mental health challenges of doing a doctoral degree, risk factors associated to them, and potential practices and solutions to face them. But I have never really written about the scale of the problem: how many people suffer from these challenges? is it hundreds of people, thousands, tens of thousands? This is a notoriously hard question to answer, not only because mental health is still a taboo subject in many cultures, but also because good estimates of the number of doctoral students worldwide, were unavailable\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip; until now. Several recent studies and scientific reports have finally given us the pieces of data to peg a number to this everyday drama of doctoral education.\nThe numbers What percentage of doctoral students are anxious? A recent systematic review looking at mental health issues in the doctorate estimated the prevalence of anxiety problems among doctoral students at 17%1. This figure may be lower than some other studies I have seen2, but it probably is a less biased estimate\u0026hellip; Still, that is one in every six students!\nWhat percentage of doctoral students are depressed? In the same study, they also estimated the prevalence of depression among doctoral students at 24%1. That is almost one in every four students!\nWhat percentage of doctoral students have thought about suicide? I had not even thought about answering this question, but I have heard of cases of suicide during the doctorate. The same review also tried to look at suicidal ideation (i.e., considering ending one\u0026rsquo;s own life), but the data from the studies was too small and heterogeneous1: the prevalence in the reviewed studies range from 2-12%. Hence, maybe 5% is a reasonable, kinda conservative guesstimate.\nWhat percentage of doctoral students will never finish the PhD? Classic texts on the topic of doctoral dropout (or doctoral attrition, as it is often called in the literature) mention dropout rates in the 40-60% range3, with 10-20% higher rates in online/distance doctoral degrees (that\u0026rsquo;s 50-80%!)4. For triangulation, a more recent study in Belgium gave out a probable 38-45% of attrition5. Hence, estimating that 40% of doctoral students that start a PhD will never finish it, is not unreasonable (actually, I\u0026rsquo;d say it is very conservative, given that most institutions around the world will have less resources and will be less concerned about their doctoral students dropping out than the aforementioned Belgian university).\nHow many doctoral students are out there? A recent report for the UK Council for Graduate Education estimates that 2,882,975 doctoral students are enrolled in doctoral programs worldwide6. The author of the report acknowledges that this is also a conservative estimate, since there were several countries (and institutions) that were not accounted for in his data.\nPutting these numbers together, we can thus give a (conservative) answer guesstimate to the questions we posed at the top of this post:\n 490,105 PhD students are suffering from anxiety right now. 691,914 PhD students are depressed right now. 144,149 of current PhD students have thought about suicide. 1,153,190 of current PhD students will not finish their studies.  Wow.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rHow many PhD students suffer from dropout and mental health issues worldwide?\n\r\r\rA hopeful note Now that I see those numbers, this may be the most depressing post I\u0026rsquo;ve ever written here. Yet, despite the huge numbers, not everything is doom and gloom. Each of us, no matter how anxious or depressed (or convinced to drop out), still has free will. We still have a choice. Many options, actually7.\nWhat these numbers show is that this is a real, very common problem. It is not an easy problem to solve (or someone would have solved it already); it is a global problem with many factors feeding into it \u0026ndash; economic, social, institutional, personal\u0026hellip; So, if you are part of one (or more) of these collectives, know that you are not alone. Many others are also suffering, and your response to this suffering is not unreasonable. There is nothing inherently wrong with you.\nOnce we realize that our situation is not that rare, the next step is to realize that it is OK to talk about it. Talk about it with whoever you trust: with your friends and family, with your colleagues, with your supervisor. Most universities and institutions have services or resources for counseling their students \u0026ndash; use them! Seek professional help. It is not a sign of weakness to seek help.\nFinally, know that there exist solutions for these problems, from big evidence-based therapy approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy8 (CBT) or acceptance and commitment therapy9 (ACT)\u0026hellip; but also small everyday gestures and practices (like connecting with our purpose to do the PhD, or getting out of our heads and continuing to do the work).\nMany have suffered from similar problems\u0026hellip; and have been able to get out of them, finish their PhD, and learn a lot about research, academia and themselves. Even with extremely bad luck or circumstances, you can do it. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a genius with great luck to do a PhD.\nTake care, and see you next week!\nWere you surprised by the numbers I have given? Did you think they would be lower, or higher?

But, how exactly can we use this chronobiology knowledge to craft a daily routine that is both productive and healthy, and fitting to our particular situation? In this post, I borrow from the habits and routines of an expert on the topic (Stanford neurobiologist Andrew Huberman) ten easy protocols you can put in practice to make every day your best day.\nAs you may have guessed if you have read the blog for some time, I am fascinated with how we humans work. One thing that always surprises me is how, some days, my energy, my concentration levels and humor are so high that everything feels effortless; and others, it\u0026rsquo;s like swimming in molasses (and, sometimes, both feelings come on the same day!). Fortunately, the more I learn about research on chronobiology and the physiology of sleep, the more these variations start making sense. Yet, there is so much research (and non-evidence-based advice!) out there, that I am oftentimes confused about what to implement in my own life. How to prioritize health and cognitive outcomes, but also have enough time to do what is important for us (like finishing that godd%\u0026amp;$%d paper)? Aren\u0026rsquo;t there any cheap, simple, time-efficient actions we can take quickly, and get on with our day?\nI was trying to build up such a catalogue of habits and advice by myself, through a lot of reading (and a lot of haphazard trial and error)\u0026hellip; when I came across this podcast episode from the Huberman Lab. Andrew Huberman is a neurobiology and ophtalmology professor at Stanford, who shares some of the same interests. In this episode, he put together 17 daily habits (what he calls \u0026ldquo;protocols\u0026rdquo;), which he uses at specific times throughout his day to stay both healthy and effective. Since he is a (quite productive) researcher, I figured many of these habits would also work for me, and for any doctoral students or more senior researchers reading this.\nIf you have two hours and would like the full nerdy detail of the 17 protocols and why they work, I heartily recommend hearing the full podcast episode. If you want a quick (and partial) summary you can implement right away, you can just read on below.\nI have selected the ten habits I think could be most generalizable to PhD students and researchers across the board. I shied away from nutrition or supplementation advice, whose effects probably depend a lot on your genetics, particular situation, history\u0026hellip; and especially, on your target/goals (what is each of us trying to \u0026ldquo;optimize\u0026rdquo; for? longevity? weight loss? cognitive performance? at what costs?). In this sense, these protocols have been selected by Huberman according to his goals (which seem to value more work productivity than, say, physical performance), and circumstances (he is apparently single and, as an academic, he has certain freedom of schedule). Your circumstances will certainly be different, so not all habits may fit you. But they seem good starting points to try out and assess for yourself.\nTen science-backed habits for a healthy and productive day  Note down your waking time\u0026hellip; or, more generally, track (roughly) your sleep (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #1). This one is part of my journaling and habit tracking practice, which I do \u0026ldquo;old school\u0026rdquo; in a piece of paper. Along with knowing your approximate sleep time, this will let you know how much sleep you are getting. Let\u0026rsquo;s remember, lack of sleep is behind many of PhD students\u0026rsquo; ailments, from poor productivity to depression). Thus, knowing how much you sleep can be a first step towards tweaking your sleep hygiene habits (or seek professional help, if none of that works). Also, by substracting two hours from your average wakeup time, you can find your temperature minimum, around which most of your REM sleep is happening. You can use this knowledge to shift your body clock (e.g., if you have jetlag or shift work) and do other interesting stuff, if needed. Go for a walk in the morning, shortly after you get out of bed (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #2). This practice (apparently called \u0026ldquo;forward ambulation\u0026rdquo; in the literature), and the \u0026ldquo;optic flow\u0026rdquo; of images and eye movements it generates, seems to be very effective in lowering the activity of the brain\u0026rsquo;s amygdala, which in turn leads to lower anxiety and fear1. Huberman uses this to put himself in a state of alertness and focus (without being anxious or stressed). Personally, I used this during the first months of the pandemic lockdowns (by going for a short walk to a nearby park before coming back home to work), and found it a nice way to start working focusedly (see point 5 below). I should bring this back again into my schedule\u0026hellip; Get natural sunlight on your eyes for 10-30 minutes, early in the morning (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #3). This practice is supposed to increase our alertness (via certain neurons located in our eyes), and sends several other signals to our organs (thus supporting better immune and hormonal function). It also helps us sleep better the next night (by timing melatonin onset). Do this even on cloudy days (maybe make the exposure a bit longer, then) and, if possible, don\u0026rsquo;t wear sunglasses (but do not look directly into the sun or anything else that is painful!). This habit is especially easy to combine with point 2 above, if you take a walk (or a run) outdoors early in the morning. Hydrate! (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #4). We have heard this advice so many times that it may be redundant to say it\u0026hellip; But, still, I find that I often forget to take the recommended two- to three-liters of fluids every day (preferably water, but could also be tea, juices, milk\u0026hellip;). Further, Huberman adds a bit of salt to his water, on the basis that those minerals are good for neuronal function. Do a stretch of deep, focused work early-ish in the morning (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #7). In this blog, we have long touted the benefits of distraction-free  stretches of deep work  as a way to make the most of our limited time and attention to deal with cognitively-hard tasks like writing or data analysis. Huberman cites work on ultradian cycles2 (the theory that the nervous system works in cycles of activity and recovery, lasting roughly 90 minutes) to suggest that we cannot really focus on a task for more than 90 minutes in a row. He thus uses this first 90-minute stretch to tackle the most important and hard task of the day. Huberman also does (and I heartily recommend) another 90-minute stretch of deep work in the afternoon, just after his nap/break (see point 7 below). Three hours a day of deep, hard work does not seem like a lot\u0026hellip; yet, many of us cannot even get that much out of our days. In my experience, if taken seriously, two of these \u0026ldquo;deep work stretches\u0026rdquo; can be as effective as much longer periods of \u0026ldquo;sorta focused\u0026rdquo; time. But, of course, if you can get 3, or 4, or 5 stretches of focused work done, that\u0026rsquo;s even better! Do physical exercise five times a week (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #8). This practice is not only aims at helping our physical health and longevity; also, exercise has been strongly linked with brain health and cognitive function (because of increased blood flow to the brain and better hormonal health affecting the brain). Huberman often does his exercise just after the (morning) 90-minute cognitive work stretch (point 5 above). He suggests exercise sessions should be 45-60 minutes long (since longer bouts of exercise may provoke excessive release of cortisol). He also suggests to alternate strength (e.g, weights, bodyweight) and endurance training (e.g., running, swimming, cycling, etc.) in a 3+2 ratio: 3 days a week of strength and 2 days of endurance every week (and then, after 12 weeks, switching to 2+3). Personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t follow these proportions ultra-rigorously, but this kind of rhythm has proven quite sustainable and beneficial for me. I will not go into the exact exercise routines to follow, as there is plenty of advice out there on that, including Huberman\u0026rsquo;s own take on this (see this other podcast episode and this other one). Take a short break to reset sometime after lunch (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #11). This can take the form of a short nap, or what Huberman calls \u0026ldquo;non-sleep deep rest\u0026rdquo; (NSDR), a concept that encompasses many different practices and protocols, from meditation or yoga nidra, to hypnosis. In general, these are practices that induce deep relaxation and, in some cases, focus (both of which will be helpful to tackle the second half of the day in full force). Huberman seems particularly fond of hypnosis (not the sketchy, stage type of hypnosis, but rather a sort of semi-meditative focusing exercises for particular purposes like reducing anxiety, pain or even stop smoking) and the Reveri app, based on the research by David Spiegel3. However, I am not sure how much its benefits depend on the person being \u0026ldquo;susceptible\u0026rdquo; to hypnosis (a trait for which there are apparently clinical measurement scales4). Personally, I can vouch for the effectiveness of the humble siesta, in the form of a short, less-than-30-min nap, from which I tend to wake up tremendously refreshed and focused. Longtime readers of the blog will also remember that I am a big fan of mindfulness meditation (e.g., body scan or awareness of breathing), which can also be very restorative and focus-supporting. Try different options and see what works best for you: the effects and preferences are bound to vary from person to person. For instance, we probably should avoiding napping if we tend to have trouble falling/staying asleep at night (then, meditation or hypnosis may be a better option). Whatever form it takes, a purposeful break in the early afternoon is probably a good idea, to make the most out of the natural post-prandial slump and continue our day full of energy. View (outdoors) evening light to support sleep (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #13). It seems that the mix of light wavelengths we get when we put ourselves somewhere outdoors towards the late afternoon (e.g., going for a walk outside at sunset) helps release melatonin (a hormone that helps us fall asleep) at the right time when we go to bed later on. Apparently, this \u0026ldquo;sunset light viewing\u0026rdquo; also helps us avoid some of the bad effects that bright lights late in the evening (including TV and other screens) have for our sleep quality. In any case, do avoid bright lights and screens from 11pm-4am, if you want to have a great night\u0026rsquo;s sleep! Optimize falling and staying asleep (Protocol #15), by taking a hot bath or shower (or sauna) before bed. Paradoxically, these uses of heat help cool our bodies, which is quite critical for falling asleep. Keeping our bedroom dark, cool and quiet (and the other sleep hygiene tips we saw in the post on sleep) will also help us fall (and stay!) asleep. In his podcast, Huberman also discusses certain supplements he takes, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t found the need to implement that additional layer of help (other than getting the occasional mug of camomile tea before bed, which naturally contains apigenin). In contrast, I can vouch for the beneficial effects of other behavioral tools for sleeping, like particular forms of breathwork (see the \u0026ldquo;whiskey breathing\u0026rdquo; in this TED talk) or progressive muscle relaxation, which tend to knock me out quite quickly (and have smaller chances of side effects than pharmacological solutions). Do not change your routine too much on weekends and when recovering from a bad night\u0026rsquo;s sleep or an all-nighter (Huberman\u0026rsquo;s Protocol #17). Apparently, the disruption to wakeup and sleep times has worse effects than an occasional night of bad sleep. Thys, we should try to keep our wake up time (and morning light viewing, see point 2) quite constant, even on weekends. Even if that means getting a bit less sleep (as also confirmed by sleep expert Matt Walker). The classic habit of sleeping in on the weekends, or going to bed unusually early after an all-nighter, might not be such a good idea. How much shifting is too much? The rule of thumb I\u0026rsquo;ve read in some of the sleep science literature is to stay below one hour of shift, from one day to the next5.  Implementation tips How should we use this list of habits? Is it all-or-nothing, or is it OK if we don\u0026rsquo;t do one of them? My impression is that implementing as many of them as you can, within the flexibility that your particular circumstances allow, will bring benefits. The good news is that these are free tools, and many of them do not really take up that much time. I also like the \u0026ldquo;bookending\u0026rdquo; approach they take: they tell you what to do at the beginning and the end of the day, but they leave the rest quite flexible. Other quick tips I\u0026rsquo;ve come across when trying to put these routines in place, include:\n  Be creative. Although these practices seem very regimented, they can be implemented in many ways, and could probably be meshed into our existing obligations. Do we have to take calls in the afternoon? Why not do it while we walk in the sunset (point 8)? Do we have a balcony at home? Why not do our first stretch of focused work sitting there and getting our sunny dose (points 3 and 5)? Walking our dogs or taking kids to school on foot, instead of going by car (point 2), etc.\n  Customize to geographic and life context. These habits were devised by someone single, living in the temperate climate of California. Use your judgement and change them as needed. For instance, going for a run at midday is probably a bad idea if we are in Spain in the summer, but it might our best bet to get some rays of sun during a winter in Estonia.\n  Do combos, i.e., stack multiple routines so that we do them simultaneously or in rapid succession. For instance, sleep expert Matt Walker combines points 3 (morning sunlight) and 6 (exercise), by getting his exercise in the morning in a gym that faces the sun. I do a triple combo on the days that I run, by doing it first thing in the morning (thus knocking points 2, 3 and 6 in one go!).\n  Piggyback these habits on top of other routines we already do, as a way to remember them and make them stick. For instance, we could put a jug of water in the foyer, close to the place where we leave our keys after a walk, to remember to hydrate (point 4). Or we could leave a post-it (or our walking shoes) next to the journal we write in after the workday, to remind us that we want to go for an evening walk (point 8).\n  Of course, the usual disclaimers are in order: this post does not constitute healthcare advice (nor am I qualified to give such advice), and it is intended for informational purposes only. If any of the tips and habits above conflict with a pre-existing condition or treatment, or become painful somehow, consult with a healthcare professional. Et cetera. But, for most people, these habits should have wide safety margins.\nThe diagram below summarizes the tips and habits mentioned in this post.

However, not everyone will benefit to the same degree, and different kinds of journaling have different advantages\u0026hellip; if done correctly over a sustained period of time. In this post, I will go over different research-backed journaling exercises and tips to make your journaling most effective.\nNB: this is the second of a two-part series on journaling (beyond the classic lab notebook) during the PhD. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t read it, you may want to know about different kinds of journaling practices and their research-backed benefits, covered in the previous post.\nKeeping a journal of daily events, thoughts and feelings, has a long tradition and lots of benefits, from better psychological wellbeing (expressive writing), better quality of relationships (gratitude journaling) or less stress after a traumatic experience (Interapy). Yet, we also saw that these benefits vary a lot from one kind of exercise to another, and from one person to another. Assuming we think a journaling practice is worth trying\u0026hellip; what exactly should we write about?\nPrompt matters Here are a few prompts taken from real scientific studies and other resources, to kickstart your journaling practice:\n  Three Good Things (gratitude journaling): \u0026ldquo;Write down three things that went well for you today. For each of them:\n Give the event a short title. Write down exactly what happened in as much detail as possible, including where you were, what you did or said, and, if others were involved, what they did or said. Write about how this event made you feel (at the time and later). Explain what you think caused this event—why it happened. If you find yourself focusing on negative feelings, try to refocus your mind on the good event and the positive feelings that came with it.\u0026quot;    The classic expressive (expressive writing): \u0026ldquo;Write down (for at least 20 minutes) your deepest emotions and thoughts about an emotional challenge that has been affecting your life. Write only for yourself. Don’t write about a trauma too soon after it has happened if it feels too overwhelming. (Optional) After four days of writing like this, try writing from the perspectives of other people involved in the event or situation.\u0026quot;\n You can find other expressive writing prompts about different topics in this resource by Duke University.    Inspired in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)1 (journal therapies): \u0026ldquo;Write about an example real situation in which you have caught yourself doing \u0026lsquo;all or nothing\u0026rsquo; thinking (i.e., the tendency to see situations as either black or white).\n Describe the situation. Describe what you thought/felt about the situation, and how thinking like this impacts you and others. Write a new thought in which you consider the situation in a less binary way. Finally, write down what do you think and feel after doing the exercise.\u0026quot;    Morning pages2 (creativity-oriented): \u0026ldquo;Write three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, first thing in the morning. There is no wrong way to do this exercise. It is about anything and everything that crosses your mind–and it is for your eyes only. Just put three pages of anything on the page\u0026hellip;and then do three more pages tomorrow.\u0026quot;\n This can be especially helpful if you find yourself with a case of \u0026ldquo;doctoral writer\u0026rsquo;s block\u0026rdquo;.    Reflecting on your progress (retrospective-prospective): \u0026ldquo;Please write a small paragraph narrating the main things you have done today, or which have happened to you. Focus especially on whether you have achieved your goals, whether you have progressed or not, why do you think that is, what emotions and thoughts this has prompted, or how you think you should handle similar events in the future. (Optional, but recommended) Then, please describe what are the main goals and tasks you have for tomorrow, especially those related with your doctoral thesis.\u0026quot;\n We have used a variant of this prompt in doctoral workshops and studies focusing on making progress in the PhD, since progress has been found to be a critical motivational factor for finishing the doctorate3.      The two-minute morning (prospective and gratitude): \u0026ldquo;In a card or post-it, write at the beginning of each day, three things (completing each sentence):\n I will let go of… I am grateful for… I want to focus on…\u0026quot;    Rose, Thorn, Bud (learning, retrospective): \u0026ldquo;Highlight three things from today:\n Rose = A highlight, success, small win, or something positive that happened. Thorn = A challenge you experienced or something you can use more support with. Bud = New ideas that have blossomed or something you are looking forward to knowing more about or experiencing.\u0026quot;   This very short journal is, in a sense, similar to the \u0026ldquo;two-minute mornings\u0026rdquo; above, with a retrospective orientation. It is also a common exercise in teams using design thinking, to continuously learn about their work.    We can find many more prompts for different styles of journaling here.\n  We could also just describe the events of the day, in a simple matter-of-fact way (i.e., which is what I thought of when I first heard about keeping a diary). Yet, we should not expect a lot of benefits from this exercise alone, as this kind of factual writing is used in some studies as a control condition (i.e., researchers do not expect this to have any particular effect). Yet, you could still get a learning benefit from this kind of journaling, as long as you dedicate some time regularly (e.g., once a week, once a month) to review the diary entries and reflect on any patterns that appear (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Tuesdays I\u0026rsquo;m much less productive\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;When I work at the office I am interrupted all the time\u0026rdquo;, etc.).\nHow to journal effectively? Tips and tricks OK, so now we know what to write about\u0026hellip; what else does research tell us about how to keep a journaling practice that is likely to benefit us, physically and mentally?\n  Sustained over time: One of the key markers of larger benefits from a journaling practice is to actually do it, for a long period of time4,5 (we are talking at least 5-12 weeks of sustained practice). Yet, many of the research studies also had high dropout rates6,7 (i.e., people that stopped doing the practice before the end of the study). Thus, we know many people find journaling difficult, be it due to everyday busyness or because people start doubting the benefits of doing it. If you want it to have an effect, keep at it!\n  Make it easy, make it tiny\u0026hellip; at least at the beginning. How can we make our journaling practice a habit and reap those benefits? One crucial insight in recent habit-forming literature8 is that the key to making a habit \u0026ldquo;stick\u0026rdquo; is to make it very small. The idea is to lower any barriers to do the behavior (in terms of effort and logistics) until the automaticity is developed in our brains. For instance, we could buy a paper notebook to journal in, define a moment when we will do it routinely (e.g., after another existing habit like brushing our teeth in the evening), put the notebook and the pen in a place where we will see it in that moment, and commit to doing it for just a very short time (e.g., two minutes each day). Then, do it for some weeks. Once the habit has developed, we can expand the time we take to do it. But, remember, there are documented benefits of certain journaling practices, even if we do it for as little as two minutes9\n  Be concrete. Another common feature of many kinds of research-backed journaling exercises is the emphasis on describing the events, feelings and thoughts in as much detail as possible10. We should not just write that \u0026ldquo;a colleague berated me today\u0026rdquo;. Rather, we can describe the context, who was there, what they said exactly, and what we felt (our body sensations, thoughts, emotions) back then. It seems that this vividness is key to bringing back the unprocessed emotions and processing them (or learning about the situation11). Indeed, some studies suggest that this vividness can transform a neutral event description into a beneficial intervention12.\n  Unblock yourself. Many writers (and PhD students are writers, too!) are familiar with the experience of \u0026ldquo;writer\u0026rsquo;s block\u0026rdquo;: we are just unable to write, be it because of a lack of ideas, or an inability to put our ideas into words. Although the lower stakes of writing \u0026ldquo;for your eyes only\u0026rdquo; in a journal are less likely to trigger such a block, I have found cases of doctoral students that develop such an aversion to writing that even journaling becomes unpleasant or impossible. On a day when we face such a journaling block, typical techniques to try include: just write anything, very fast13 (even if it is \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to write\u0026rdquo; over and over), writing snippets of conversations/facts/feelings/fantasies, or doing free association mindmaps14 (in which we just write a word, and then link to it other words that this one suggests, and then other words that we associate to those, etc.). In the long term, we can try doing the \u0026ldquo;morning pages\u0026rdquo; exercise I describe above for several weeks: this should slowly train our \u0026ldquo;creative muscles\u0026rdquo; and stop our brain from associating the act of sitting to write with being blocked.\n  Mix and match\u0026hellip; to each day\u0026rsquo;s needs. Once we have our journaling habit established, what journaling practice should we do? Given the variety of practices out there (and their benefits), maybe the best we can do is to try them all, depending on the needs of the day. If something troubling happened today, we can try a longer \u0026ldquo;expressive writing\u0026rdquo; exercise. If we have too much negative self-talk today, the CBT-inspired one could be a good choice. If we are having trouble writing that damned paper, we can do morning pages for a few days. And in any case, doing a gratitude-style exercise at least once a week is advisable.\n  Review your journal regularly and learn from it. While writing a journal may have many benefits, the act of reading the entries afterwards and reflecting on them will provide us with insights about how we work, what works for us, patterns and pitfalls of thought. Still, the rest of the tips for effective journaling apply: we may not learn much from reading three-word, vague journal entries. Since reading a whole year of journaling can be a daunting task, incorporate this reading into some other regular routine you already have established. For instance, I find it helpful to do this on a weekly basis, and then again at a higher level, I review these weekly syntheses within the reviews I do every quarter. In this way, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for a whole year to reap the learning benefits of my journaling.\n  Specific tips for expressive writing. Studies on this journaling technique suggest that we are more likely to benefit if we disclose in our writing things or details we had previously held back15. Again, being specific and sustaining the exercise over a long period of time16,17 (several weeks) will also help. Some studies found that it is more effective if the writing focuses on both cognitions and emotions18 (e.g., describing what we think or how we make sense of the experience, rather than just how it made us feel). Others advice to focus on both negative and positive aspects of the experience18,9.\n  Specific tips for gratitude journaling. Experts suggest that it is important to not only describe what we are grateful for (e.g., name the event or the person), but also why this is positive and important to us19. This not only leads to greater happiness boosts, but also can help us start identifying patterns of things we value in life. For instance, by reviewing these gratitude exercises quarterly, I realized that simple things like walks in nature and sharing a meal and conversations with friends make up a disproportionate share of my happiest moments. Henceforth, I have tried to make them a more frequent part of my life, with great effect on my overall happiness. Other studies on gratitude suggest that actually doing something to support others (aside from noticing and being grateful for the support we ourselves receive, i.e., \u0026ldquo;paying it forward\u0026rdquo;) may be an important factor explaining some of the health benefits of gratitude exercises (at least, in women)20.\n  Specific tips for learning from journaling. If we want to reap the benefits of journaling for our own self-knowledge (or, as they call it in some studies, for \u0026ldquo;metacognitive awareness\u0026rdquo;), it is recommended to use semi-structured reflections21 (rather than totally free-form reflection). One could follow the complex 21-question structure used in that study\u0026hellip; but I personally find very useful the four-question structure I describe in my post about weekly reviews. We could also use even simpler structures, like the \u0026ldquo;rose-thorn-bud\u0026rdquo; prompt I mention above.\n  The diagram below summarizes the main ideas and advice mentioned in this and the previous post:\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSummary of the ideas in the journaling posts\n\r\r\rI hope this and the previous post spurred in you the desire to try some kind of journaling practice. If it didn\u0026rsquo;t, that\u0026rsquo;s OK as well (if you\u0026rsquo;re not open to trying it, probably you would not benefit from it anyways). In any case, it is probably best if you pick and choose the practice (or practices) that best fit you as a person, and your particular circumstances. For example\u0026hellip;\nHow I journal Here\u0026rsquo;s how I have incorporated some of the practices, tips and tricks above into my own routines. This is not to say that this way is superior to others, but just to demonstrate what this \u0026ldquo;customization\u0026rdquo; may look like:\n  Every day (normally, at the end of the day before going to bed \u0026ndash; albeit now I\u0026rsquo;m experimenting with doing it as a \u0026ldquo;shutdown routine\u0026rdquo; when the work hours end), I journal for 5-10 minutes. I write about the events of the day, prevalent feelings and thoughts (e.g., if I ruminated about particular topics), and how things worked out compared to my goals for that day. I also try to include self-regulation ideas (how I could do things differently in the future). This journaling can get longer if I had a particularly difficult day (then, it looks more like an expressive writing-style entry).\n  Every day, just after the journaling, I do a little prospective journaling (i.e., setting the goals for the next day). You can read this prior post for further details on how I structure my goals of each day.\n  Every week (often, on Sundays), I make an appointment with myself to do a \u0026ldquo;weekly retrospective\u0026rdquo;. I read the week\u0026rsquo;s journal entries, and reflect upon them using a structure of four guiding questions (what went well? what would I do differently? what lessons did I learn? and, what is still puzzling me?).\n  In the same weekly review, I also do a gratitude journaling exercise (similar to the Three Good Things), since some studies suggest that a weekly gratitude journal may be more beneficial than a daily one22. Although I don\u0026rsquo;t write for very long, I make sure to identify both the event or person for which I\u0026rsquo;m grateful, but also what aspects I value especially from it/her/him (i.e., why I\u0026rsquo;m grateful).\n  Every quarter, I revise both the weekly reflections and gratitude exercises (following the same structure outlined above). There, I synthesize the positive and less-positive aspects of that quarter, important lessons learned, things that still worry or puzzle me, and things I am frequently grateful for.\n  It is worth noting that all the practices above I have followed sustainedly for months and years23 (as they say in the studies, length of treatment matters!). I don\u0026rsquo;t see a reason to stop doing them, since these habits provide me regular benefits (especially, compared with other daily habits I\u0026rsquo;ve had, like watching Netflix before bed). I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed useful insights, a sense of purpose, and an overall wellbeing more stable and more positive than it has been in a long time.\n  I never thought much about journaling (and considered it a weird use of my time)\u0026hellip; until about four years ago. I tried it and now it is an essential part of my everyday life. But, then again, I am me. And I am a weird, particular person (like everyone else). If you think you could like it or are willing to try, give it a go for some weeks (at least two, and six is probably better) and assess whether you find it useful \u0026ndash; for mental, physical health, or self-knowledge.\nEither way, I hope to see you around here next week.\nDo you have other useful journaling prompts (be them prospective or retrospective) that you would like to share? Did I miss any other important tips and tricks for having a good journaling practice?

Is your mind an unfocused maelstrom of swirling thoughts, ruminating again and again about the same worrying (or plain silly) things? Journaling has been proposed (both by ancient philosophers and modern researchers) as having many benefits, from dealing with stress and trauma, to just understanding ourselves a little better. But, can journaling be useful for us in facing the challenges of a PhD? In this post, I will take a look at the research on different kinds of journaling and what are their effects for mental and physical health.\nNB: In this post I will talk mainly about journaling for personal, non-strictly-scientific use. There is, of course, another common journaling device in many research fields: the lab notebook. It goes without saying that keeping a lab notebook is highly recommended as well, especially if your field requires it!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve never been a fan of journaling. Maybe I tried it for a while as a teenager, but the habit never stuck. I did write a sort of \u0026ldquo;lab notebook\u0026rdquo; during the first half of my PhD, but it fell down the wayside once my doctorate picked up speed and I rushed to complete its later publications and the dissertation itself1. Years later, well into my postdoc phase, I came across an interview with Jim Collins (ex-Stanford academic and business guru), in which he described how he used a short journal/spreadsheet and a simple rating system (every day was rated from -2 \u0026ndash;really bad\u0026ndash; to +2 \u0026ndash;a really great day\u0026ndash;) to understand his patterns of productivity and satisfaction. Since, back then, I was dealing with some motivational issues myself, I decided to try journaling out\u0026hellip; and now it\u0026rsquo;s one of my keystone habits for productivity and sense-making (along with the weekly and quarterly reviews).\nKeeping a diary in which you record events of the day, along with reflections or emotions that they prompted, is a practice with a long tradition, going back centuries to, at least, Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Medieval mystics, poets, Venetian merchants, and even teenagers during the II World War\u0026hellip; all seem to have gotten something out of this daily account of events. But, is keeping a journal anything more than a time-consuming hobby? Does journaling actually have psychological benefits? Is there a \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; way to keep a diary to maximize such benefits? I was quite curious about these questions myself. The rest of this post (and the next one) summarizes the answers I\u0026rsquo;ve found in the research literature.\nTypes of journaling and their (research-backed) benefits Despite its popularity and long history, journaling practices have not been studied systematically until recently. What kinds of journaling have been studied, and what is the evidence that they work?\n  Probably the oldest systematic use of journaling for psychological benefits are \u0026ldquo;journal therapies\u0026rdquo;, which started around the 1960s. Although journaling is often used as an adjunct to many other psychotherapy approaches (from psychoanalysis to cognitive-behavioral therapy), there are therapies that use journaling almost exclusively. For instance, Ira Progoff\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;intensive journal method\u0026rdquo;2 is a series of exercises written in a notebook with sections, for different areas of the writer\u0026rsquo;s life (e.g., imagined written dialogues with people, to reflect on the writer\u0026rsquo;s relationships). I have not found, however, any systematic review of the evidence for its effectiveness. As with many clinical psychotherapy approaches, the idea seems to be: \u0026ldquo;try it out if you like the idea\u0026hellip; if it works for you, it works \u0026ndash; otherwise try something else\u0026rdquo;. In the same category of journal-based psychotherapies we can find cognitive-behavioral writing therapy (CBWT, also called \u0026ldquo;Interapy\u0026rdquo;, as it is often done through the Internet), a CBT variant developed to treat post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD)3. Interapy basically consists of writing exercises purposefully tailored to act upon our cognitive biases and perceptions (e.g., by writing about a traumatic event, and then getting therapist feedback and rewriting the event in specific ways to restructure how we think about that trauma), over a period of 5 weeks. This approach has some empirical evidence of benefits for people with such traumas (in terms of, e.g., anxiety and depression)4. One common feature of these journal therapy approaches is that doing them effectively normally requires guidance5,6 so it may not be easy to pull them off in a purely self-help manner\u0026hellip; or it may even be detrimental7, if we are prone to rumination8\n  One of the most widely studied journaling practices is called \u0026ldquo;expressive writing\u0026rdquo; (writing about emotional or traumatic experiences, during several writing sessions, for about 15-30 minutes9. The initial studies and reviews on this practice found a variety of benefits of such writing, from academic performance to psychological wellbeing and even improved physiological markers9,10. Yet, as more studies (especially, randomized controlled trials) are accumulated and reviewed, more recent meta-analyses11,12,13,14 found small or no average effects. These reviews have also noted the large heterogeneity of results (i.e., effects may be quite different for different groups of people)14.\n  Another type of journaling intervention that has been studied a lot is \u0026ldquo;gratitude journaling\u0026rdquo; (a diary in which we focus specifically on things for which we are grateful). One popular form of this is the \u0026ldquo;three good things\u0026rdquo; exercise, in which we write about three particular things or events for which we are grateful, indicating also the concrete reasons or aspects for our gratitude and how the experience made us feel. The evidence-based benefits of this kind of practice are wide-ranging, including improvements on both positive (e.g., wellbeing, happiness, quality of relationships) and negative psychological variables (improvements in anxiety, stress or depression symptoms)15,16,17. There\u0026rsquo;s even evidence of benefits on physical health markers (e.g., sleep quality)18. Yet, these are not \u0026ldquo;miracle cures\u0026rdquo; that will make you instantly blissful: effect sizes in the studies are small to moderate, and some authors again mention the heterogeneity of effects (different strengths for different people)17.\n  A slightly different variant is \u0026ldquo;positive affect journaling\u0026rdquo;: writing a journal entry on a commonly used positive affect prompt (e.g., What are you thankful for? What did someone else do for you? What are any benefits or positive thoughts/feelings concerning a current stressful experience?). There is evidence of effects on anxiety or physical distress, but it is still emergent (studies are too small to make strong, generalizable claims)19,20. While the typical intervention takes about 15 minutes (over multiple days), there\u0026rsquo;s some evidence of health benefits for even shorter bouts of writing about a positive experience (or a traumatic one): as little as two minutes in two different days21 could be beneficial!\n  Journaling is, almost by definition, a retrospective exercise (i.e., we describe or reflect about a past event or experience). Yet, we could also think of a prospective counterpart to journaling: the setting of intentions or goals. This future-oriented reflection (basically, a formal goal-setting exercise) has shown benefits on academic performance (at least, in undergraduates)22. A shorter self-help intervention based on similar research evidence (but itself not studied systematically) are the \u0026ldquo;Two Minute Mornings\u0026rdquo;, popularized by writer Neil Pasricha: writing down each morning one regret, one gratitude, and 1-3 goals for the day (in a sense, similar to the daily review I proposed in a previous post).\n  There is, however, one aspect of journaling which I find critical, and which I haven\u0026rsquo;t found so many studies about (if you know of some, let me know!): the learning effects of journaling, and of reviewing periodically those journal entries (e.g., in a weekly review). This learning aspect (as explained by Jim Collins in the interview I mentioned at the beginning of the post) is actually what sold me on trying the practice: to understand better my patterns of work and wellbeing, and to do more of what works. This learning benefit of journaling is hinted at by large diary studies of knowledge workers23, and by studies on how self-affirmation writing exercises can help us be more resilient24. Some studies also show how reflective journaling, if adequately structured (including descriptions and evaluations of experiences, but also potential improvements for future regulation) has benefits for metacognitive awareness (our capacity to understand and regulate our own thinking)25. It is even starting to be studied as a student-directed tool to fight procrastination26 In my own (anecdotal) experience, writing these diary entries (and my reflecting upon reading a whole week of them) forces my brain to slow down to the speed of (hand)writing, and lets me examine my thinking without the logical jumps, biases and shortcuts we use in the everyday thought that happens only in our heads.\n  The bottom line: Should you journal? As we can see from the review of scientific evidence above, the potential benefits of journaling are multifarious\u0026hellip; but the evidence for their benefits is not so clear-cut (with gratitude journaling showing maybe the most solid evidence of benefits). Some researchers have suggested that this heterogeneity may be due to individual factors like personal preference14: maybe how much journaling helps us depends on how much we hate (or love) the act of journaling, how useful we think it will be\u0026hellip; and whether we are able to sustain it over time (a seemingly critical factor in achieving benefits17,19). This is represented in the (totally un-scientific) graph below:\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rHow much journaling benefits us depends on who we are\n\r\r\rThis heterogeneity of effects is very common in human psychology. That\u0026rsquo;s probably why so many therapy approaches exist \u0026ndash; every one of them may work on some people, but not on all people. This variance is also supported by my own experience working with PhD students: everyone\u0026rsquo;s doctorate is different (not only because of its topic and department/lab, but also due to individual differences in personality, beliefs, and many other contextual variables). Few things work for absolutely everyone. Indeed, this seems to be an ongoing debate in psychology and therapy: how much should research focus on finding average effects across a group of people (what they call the nomothetic approach) vs. finding particular dynamics, effects and interventions for an individual over time (the idiographic approach)27. Probably, both kinds of research are important and needed. The nomothetic perspective gives us good starting points that are likely to work. Yet, the idiographic perspective is crucial: what works specifically for us? We may find that the important question is not whether journaling helps everyone (on average), but rather, in which part of the distribution are we? The side of those that benefit, or those that do not? Only you can find that out.\nMy advice would be to look at these different kinds of journaling and ask: does any of them sound like something you would like to try (for a month or, potentially, indefinitely)? If so, give it a try for several weeks and then review the entries and how do you feel after doing it for a while. But you also may be wondering: how exactly do I do it? what are good journaling prompts and what are the best ways to keep a diary, according to this body of research? I will cover these nitty-gritty details about how to have a better chance of making your journaling effective, in the next post.\nDo you journal or keep some kind of personal diary? if not, what is stopping you? if you do, do you follow one of the approaches above, or something else? what have you learned by doing it? Let us know in the comments section below!\n  In retrospect, the part of my PhD which I enjoyed the most coincided roughly with the time I was keeping that lab notebook in a wiki. Was that causal or casual? I\u0026rsquo;ll never know for sure, but the research in the rest of this post makes me think that giving in to time pressure and the \u0026ldquo;publish or perish\u0026rdquo; mentality, may not have been such a good idea, given my motivational problems later on\u0026hellip; \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Progoff, I.

Many of them are reflective and/or open in nature. Yet, we often slap whatever answer first pops into our brains, and run with it. In today\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;quickie\u0026rdquo; post, I share a simple practice that can help in getting over this availability bias to get deeper, better answers to your open reflective questions.\n What lessons have I learned from this (failed) experiment? What things went well this past week? How could I apply this new data analysis technique I learned to my thesis research? What are the biggest obstacles for me to make progress in the dissertation? If I had to repeat this week all over again, what would I do differently? What is the most important goal I want to set for myself this semester? What was most interesting about this interview I just had with a study participant? What is the problem I want to solve with my research?  These are just some examples of questions that we need to answer (sometimes, repeatedly) during a PhD. While these are not the uber-important \u0026ldquo;research questions\u0026rdquo; that we answer by analyzing data, these reflective questions are critical to our learning to become independent researchers and to develop our research contributions. One common feature of all these questions is that they are open, in that they do not have a single answer, and very often it is not even clear whether there exists a \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; answer. Normally, the answers to these questions do not rely on getting information from the outside \u0026ndash; rather, they come from looking inside ourselves (i.e., reflecting).\nWhat normally happens when we ask ourselves this kind of questions, is that an answer pops into our minds, often quite quickly. Since we have many other things to do, we take that one answer as the answer (since it was the first to appear). And we build on it, or run to the next thing, since we are so busy.\nBut, was that first answer actually a good one? Was it the best one we had inside? Most probably, the answer was a product of availability, recency, salience or other kinds of biases that make our brains favor ideas that are striking, recent or just easily recalled, independent of their objective quality as responses to the question1. This kind of mental shortcut is of course very useful in some parts of our everyday lives (and were even more useful for our ancestors evolving in the savannah2), but in many modern creative tasks, this \u0026ldquo;sticking to the first solution\u0026rdquo; strategy often leads to objectively inferior results3.\nThis does not mean that we should start questioning every single answer whose consequences are negligible (what flavor of ice-cream should I choose today? Hmmmm\u0026hellip;). Yet, if the question at hand is of enough importance that we can spare 5 minutes to get a better answer, read on. The technique I propose below is especially useful when we find ourselves alone4 looking for an answer to an open question (i.e., many good answers are possible), which is reflective or creative in nature (i.e., not about analyzing evidence systematically).\nGetting over the first answer Here is a simple reflection exercise to help us get over this \u0026ldquo;first answer syndrome\u0026rdquo;5. You can read the whole sequence first to familiarize yourself with the instructions, and then do it on your own. Alternatively, you can record yourself while saying it out loud, and then replay it to follow the exercise.\n Sit down in a quiet place, where you will not be interrupted for a few minutes. Allow your eyes to close (if that\u0026rsquo;s comfortable), and bring your attention to the sensations of breathing (e.g., in the belly, the nostrils or the chest). Imagine yourself standing beside a quiet body of water (maybe a lake, a still river, or a well). Perhaps it’s some place you’ve seen before, or one that you have imagined right now. Notice the landscape around it, the weather, the temperature of the air. With your mind\u0026rsquo;s eye, look at the ground by your feet, and pick up a stone. Feel its weight, its temperature and texture against the palm of your hand. Now, hold the stone over the water, and let it become a question. And the question is: \u0026laquo;add here the question you are reflecting on\u0026raquo; Pause for some moments, and let the words of the question sink in. Allowing the stone to drop into the water, notice if an answer comes with the first splash, as the stone hits the water. Just wait. Wait for the stone to drop deeper into the well. As the stone/question sinks deeper, see if another answer arises like bubbles, perhaps from a deeper place. Or maybe it is the same answer, that\u0026rsquo;s OK as well. Imagine the stone falling all the way to the bottom of the well and settling there. Allow another answer to arise if one is ready to do so. Or it may be the same answer again. There is no right answer. Even no answer at all is a kind of answer. Take a few more breaths and remember the different answers you\u0026rsquo;ve given to your question. Once you open your eyes, note them down so that you don\u0026rsquo;t forget them.  That\u0026rsquo;s it. Although the instructions stop at three answers, we could easily extend this exercise to, e.g., five answers, or until no other answers to our question bubble up.\nWhy it (might) work I came across this mix of visualization and mindfulness exercise in a recent mindfulness course I attended. I have tried it several times and I have always been surprised at the variety and creativity of the answers I got, which were not in my initial mindset. I am still not very sure why it works, but recent research linking mindfulness with being more protected from cognitive biases6 may have something to do with it.\nIn any case, I hope this little exercise becomes another useful tool in your toolbox towards a better, happier PhD.\nDid you try this reflection exercise? How did it go? Do you have other tricks or practices to boost your creativity and decision-making?

I have co-organized a few of these events during the first waves of the pandemic, which students seemed to find useful (the events, not the pandemic!). In this post, I describe the (online) event format that we followed, in case it helps future organizers of similar events. If you are a PhD student, I hope this post will also encourage you to attend one!\nI still remember vividly my first Doctoral Consortium (DC). I was halfway through my PhD, in the \u0026ldquo;mid-point slump\u0026rdquo; in which you have some ideas and results already, but still no coherence of the thesis ideas and no journal papers published. I was supposed to be reaching the end of the dissertation, but for me there was no end in sight. I was a bit demoralized, to be honest. Then, at the DC, I got to meet big names in the field which I had been citing again and again, and other doctoral students in my research community (back then, computer-supported collaborative learning, or CSCL). Not sure what part of it worked on me, but it did: I exited the event with a new energy, eager to see the rest of the conference, and the rest of my PhD. Maybe it was because I then had some more people I could talk to in the crowded but solitary coffee breaks of the conference. Maybe because the mentors had made links between my work and that of others in the community, which I had not seen myself. Maybe just having such big names looking at my work and honestly considering it as worthy of discussion, and dedicating their (probably scarce) time to talk about it had this \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo;1 effect.\nDoctoral consortia?? But let\u0026rsquo;s back up a step: what are doctoral consortia? (yes, the plural of consortium \u0026ndash;from Latin\u0026ndash; is consortia). The word literally means \u0026ldquo;partnership\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;association\u0026rdquo; and, more generally, \u0026ldquo;sharing the same fate\u0026rdquo;. n the context of research communities, a DC is a \u0026ldquo;formal, scheduled event at which doctoral students, whose work has advanced beyond detailed design, present their research for feedback from external scholars and peers who have reviewed advance reports on the work presented\u0026rdquo;1. If you have never heard about DCs (in some communities/conferences they also call them \u0026ldquo;workshop for early career researchers\u0026rdquo;, or something else), here is the quick summary:\n  What is it? as the definition above notes, it is a formal event for PhD students to present their dissertation ideas and progress. The main goal is to get feedback from more expert researchers. Sometimes, it also has a component of meeting up and group-building among doctoral students in that research community.\n  Where does it happen? Most often, DCs happen as part of scientific conferences (as a separate workshop or track). Yet, we can also find similar feedback-oriented sessions in summer/winter schools or other doctoral training events.\n  Should you go there? Yes.\n  Why go there? Many reasons. Mainly, better integration into your research community (which is a factor in persisting in your PhD2. You will get an idea of how other doctoral dissertations look like in your area (and that nobody\u0026rsquo;s dissertation is perfect \u0026ndash; good to fight the ubiquitous impostor syndrome). You will meet peers and maybe make some friends/acquaintances (which is nice for the informal breaks when you are new to a conference). You also meet potential future employers (the experts who will give feedback, who often are in the lookout for talent to hire as postdocs later on).\n  When to go there? Sometime around the middle part of your doctoral studies. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go to a DC when you are in the finalization stage of the PhD, when all ideas are set and you are just focused on finishing. Also, going at the very beginning (when the dissertation idea is not so clear or your have no empirical data yet) might not be so beneficial, because the discussions quickly get rather vague and abstract.\n  Yet, sometimes an example is worth a thousand words. To see how these events look like and how they are announced, you could look at the DC at ICALT (which I co-organized, in the area of learning technologies), or the DC at CHI (in human-computer interaction).\nIf you are a doctoral supervisor/expert trying to organize a DC, you might also be curious exactly how to manage the event (especially, in an online format, given the still ongoing COVID pandemic). If you are a doctoral student, it might be helpful to have a more concrete example of what exactly happens there. That\u0026rsquo;s what the rest of the post will do.\nAn (online) Doctoral Consortium format The online DC format we followed was shaped by one guiding principle: maximize feedback to the students, both in terms of breadth, depth and usefulness. The other main constraint we had was, of course, the pandemic: this had to be an online event with a global audience (which implied other restrictions like timezones feasible for participants, or the limited length of an online session that is engaging for the audience).\nHence, although DCs are normally whole-day events, in our case we ended up with three two-hour sessions, one for each of the major timezones where our audience was physically located (e.g., the Americas, Europe/Africa, East Asia/Australia). How did we organize the event?\nBefore the synchronous sessions As it happens with many other types of events, the transition to an online format means that you need to prepare things in advance a bit more carefully. You cannot just \u0026ldquo;wing it\u0026rdquo;. Preparatory steps included:\n Getting the organizers together, deciding on the exact format of the event and brainstorming a considerable list of referees/experts (hopefully covering the breadth of the research community of the conference and expected submissions). Defining all the important dates (submission and review/feedback deadlines, date of the event, etc.), and the template/structure that the student submissions should take (normally, describing main aspects of the students\u0026rsquo; dissertation as a whole and their current state, often using concepts similar to those in the CQOCE diagram \u0026ndash; see this example from the ICALT conference). Also, defining additional submission requirements (e.g., an adjoining a letter of support by the students\u0026rsquo; supervisor) and a rubric with criteria that the reviewers can use to assess the submissions and decide whether they should be accepted. Contact the experts and get their agreement to revise one/a few of the submissions, on the dates defined in the previous step. Announce the DC\u0026rsquo;s call for papers (often, along with the main conference, and with a separate section within the conference website). In the call for papers, state clearly the format and structure requirements (normally, these are relatively short papers, maybe 3-8 pages long, depending on the template). Use examples in the text of the call, to show what the different parts of this document structure mean (many doctoral students are not used to writing about the thesis as a whole!). Manage submissions and reviews, as you would in any conference (if possible, use the same system the main conference uses). For instance, we used the Easychair submission system (which has a free version, if you need basic functionalities). If you have that luxury, assign reviewers on the basis not only of the topic of the student paper, but also their rough timezone (the reason for this will become obvious later on). Emphasize to the reviewers that they should prime formative feedback (or feedforward that suggests paths for improvement) over just judging whether the paper should be accepted/rejected. This step would already give the first feedback items to students. During the submission process or, preferably, after acceptance, ask both reviewers and doctoral students where they will be physically located on the day of the event. Then, create tracks/groups of students (e.g., 3-6 students per group), and assign them to 2-hour synchronous sessions in a way that is feasible according to their timezones. Also, assign one expert from your roster to each doctoral student. This expert can be (but does not need to be) among the ones that provided reviews to the student in step #4 above. The main criteria for this assignment is whether the expert agrees to be available for the corresponding synchronous session (i.e., also consider their timezone!). Ask students to prepare a short presentation about their dissertation (about 10\u0026rsquo; long, maybe restricting the number of slides and following the same structure as the paper submissions). To maximize the usefulness of the feedback, ask students to start reflecting (and include in their presentation) a few ideas about what challenges and open questions they are facing right now in their PhD. These ideas can be gathered in an online form (see this example form) and shared with the experts in advance of the session, so that they can also prepare to give more meaningful feedback.  The synchronous session The main happening of the DC are the synchronous sessions (as many as tracks/groups of students you made during preparation). These are about 2-hours long (given that they are done online, I would advice against longer sessions, as Zoom fatigue3 is likely to kick in well before that). The sequence of the session is rather simple (see also these example supporting slides) :\n  Short introduction to the session goals and structure by the DC organizers (5’).\n  Public session (about one hour long). The audience of this part includes all the students in the track/group, the corresponding experts, and any additional students/experts from other groups that are able to attend. In this part of the event, students do the short presentations of their dissertations (not more than 10-15’ long) and get short, clarificatory oral feedback from the audience (about 5 minutes). One important difference between this session and any other conference session is that the audience is provided a simple but structured written feedback form (asking for a few strong points and potential improvements, see this example), and the organizers actively encourage the audience to write on that form during the presentations and oral feedback. This enables students to receive a wider breadth of feedback from both peers and experts (rather than just receiving the ideas from the 1-2 most chatty members of the audience that are able to speak in the 5 minutes allotted to feedback). And it keeps the audience engaged and doing something meaningful, rather than passively listening and waiting (or doing their emails).\n  Private session (about 40’): This is a one-on-one session in which the student/presenter and one or more experts engage in private dialogue to find answers to the main open questions the student has, or to discuss ways to work around the student’s main challenges, as outlined in their presentations. In our DC, we used Zoom\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;breakout rooms\u0026rdquo; feature to enable these private discussions. The back-and-forth in this part of the DC allows for feedback depth and understanding (sometimes the student presentation is not clear, or further explanations are needed about experts\u0026rsquo; remarks). The discussion should probably be guided by the items raised by student (to maximize feedback usefulness as well). Yet, experts could also add their own ideas about unnoticed challenges, or other general advice (e.g., what trouble may arise down the road, from the point of view of how this particular research community).\n  Wrap-up (15’): Back together in the big group, the student presenters summarize the 1-2 main lessons or takeaway ideas for them from the session.\n  After the session Once the synchronous session ends, the DC is not over. It is rather \u0026ldquo;the beginning of the rest of your PhD\u0026rdquo;:\n The organizers send all the written feedback from the audience (given in the feedback form during the public session, see #2 above) to each of the student presenters. If the experts are up for it, encourage doctoral students to follow up their discussions and feedback, both with members of the audience and with their allotted experts, by email or any other preferred means of communication (e.g., if they have additional questions or the discussions had to be cut short due to time restrictions). As doctoral students, do not just run away to the next paper or the next thing: make sure to dedicate a stretch of time specifically to go over all the pieces of feedback received and reflecting on whether they are relevant and how they could be integrated into the dissertation. Exercises like the CQOCE diagram or the map of the thesis can be very useful for this purpose, adding or modifying elements according to the most important and applicable pieces of feedback received during the DC. Discussing these insights (and consequences for the dissertation) with supervisors is also highly recommended.  Overall, this format proved to be quite flexible and effective, and relatively simple to implement. The main challenge is the finding of topic-relevant experts and the whole scheduling of sessions according to the timezones of a worldwide audience. If I had to change something, I would maybe add some more group-building activities, some more informal socialization events. But this is still a big unsolved issue in any online conference or event.\nIf you are organizing a DC, I hope this structure helps you create a great event. If you are a student, I hope this post convinced you to attend one.\nIn both cases, please let me know how that went, in the comments below, or in the blog\u0026rsquo;s contact form.

Yet, not all breaks are created equal: timing and other factors affect their effectiveness. Continuing previous dives into chronobiology and taking holidays, this post goes over evidence-based tips and tricks to make your breaks the most restorative and energizing.\nIn a previous post, we saw that the timing we choose to do certain things (e.g., analytical or creative tasks) has an impact in our performance. As it turns out from research studies, timing also has an impact when we do *no-*things. We already covered tips and studies about longer, multi-day breaks in our post on taking holidays. Below, I go over tips and tricks to make your smaller breaks (within a workday, sometimes also called micro-breaks) more effective and energy-refilling. If you want to know more about this topic, Dan Pink\u0026rsquo;s book When1 has a great, evidence-based introduction to the subject.\nThe perfect break We have all had the experience of taking a 15-minute \u0026ldquo;email break\u0026rdquo; when writing a paper, only to find out that, when going back to writing (maybe one hour later!), we are more tired and less motivated than when we took the break. What is going on? How to avoid this kind of un-helpful breaks? In his synthesis of research studies about the science of taking breaks, Dan Pink points out five characteristics that make breaks most effective:\n Regular: Research tasks can be very long (e.g., writing a paper takes hours and hours of dedicated work). There is thus the temptation of not taking breaks until we finish the task at hand. Yet, research shows that our attention spans and energy cannot be on full throttle all the time. It is important to establish some kind of rhythm alternating focused work with small rest periods2. What length is ideal? as usual, opinions vary and evidence is fragmentary: some observational studies say that 52 minutes of work and 17 minutes of rest is optimal3, but most probably it will depend on what you are personally used to and the nature of the task you\u0026rsquo;re doing (e.g., how mentally taxing it is). In this sense, using the \u0026ldquo;Pomodoro technique\u0026rdquo; is a nice starting point to get this habit going, since it times not only your focused work periods, but also your rest periods (micro-breaks becoming procrastination rabbit-holes is also a common danger to watch out for, according to many PhD students I\u0026rsquo;ve heard from). Moving: Research on breaks also suggests that moving our bodies during breaks both helps us physically and stimulates our cognitive capacity and creativity4. In the end, our brains need sugar and other nutrients to function \u0026ndash; hence stimulating blood flow will help our mental performance after the break. Try doing stretches, pushups or squats, or simply go for a walk to the water fountain (or even brisk-walk around the block5) . I have found that my brain resists taking these breaks (I could write another paragraph during those precious five minutes!), but then many good ideas come precisely when I get off my chair. Social: The work of a PhD is often solitary, and many doctoral students self-identify as introverts \u0026ndash; thus making solitary breaks quite common. Yet, if you have access to a research team around you, or some other set of people you can take the break with, research seems to support the value of social or collective breaks6\u0026hellip; especially if you can choose whom to take the break with (remember self-determination theory? autonomy is important!). Social breaks help us focus on something other than the task we were doing (see #5 below), or get another perspective on our problem. In my personal experience (e.g., during \u0026ldquo;writing camps\u0026rdquo; for doctoral students that our department organizes), this kind of \u0026ldquo;synchronized breaks\u0026rdquo; are very powerful: there is something ancestrally satisfying in doing something along with others in the same room at the same time (and stopping it at the same time as well)\u0026hellip; Something like a group ritual. Of course, the current COVID pandemic is making these social practices a bit more challenging \u0026ndash; but not something that a bit of ingenuity and creativity cannot overcome. For instance, I have heard from doctoral students hundreds of kilometers apart, who still go for a run \u0026ldquo;together\u0026rdquo; (by calling each other on the phone and running, each one in their own place), to keep themselves energized and socialized through a long day of work. Natural: Yet another strand of research on breaks focuses on whether the setting of the break has an effect on its effectiveness. One of the most researched aspects is the benefit of outdoors natural settings7 (or even small natural elements like having plants in your office8). Being in (or seeing) natural settings and elements like trees, water streams or plants, has more restorative benefits than man-made ones like your typical office building. Take advantage of that nearby park, if you have one. Plus, outdoor natural settings tend to be safer from the point of view of COVID as well! Fully detached: Because our technological marvels make it possible to continue working anytime, anywhere, the temptation to \u0026ldquo;just check a few emails\u0026rdquo; or do some other (work-related) menial tasks while taking a break is strong. However, researchers have shown again and again that detaching ourselves psychologically from work is as important as taking ourselves physically off our chairs7. If you can, avoid doing other work tasks or talking with labmates about the same problems you were working on. If you cannot, at least talking with others might give you new ideas and perspectives on the problem you were stuck in.  Criteria #6: Varied breaks Another important aspect mentioned in Pink\u0026rsquo;s book is to introduce a bit of variety in your breaks. Doing different kinds of break activities (which have different benefits) could be useful at different moments during the day.\n Meditation (be it a simple body scan, paying attention to breathing or eating mindfully) can be an excellent source of calm and focus, and does not need to take more than a few minutes. Plus, mindfulness may have many other long-term benefits9. Personally, I find this kind of break especially useful when I have to change gears from some other complex project that makes my mind swirl with thoughts or feelings. Even short meditations seem to help with calming down those overexcited trains of thought and focusing on the next task at hand (additional tip: writing down in a piece of paper some of those thoughts/feelings may also help our brains off-load and be sure all those \u0026ldquo;open loops\u0026rdquo; will not be forgotten). Breathe. Even without the meditative component, breathing exercises are a very powerful tool for accessing our nervous system, be it for calming ourselves or for boosting our energy. You can read entire books on the subject of how to breathe10, but I have found out that learning just a few simple breathing techniques can give you enough tools to enhance most of your breaks. You can use them to calm after stressful situations (e.g., the square breathing practice), to fall sleep, become more awake, or to regain balance (see the three breathing techniques mentioned in this TED talk by yoga teacher Lucas Rockwood). Positive emotions. As we saw in a previous post about engagement in our happiness at (research) work, regularly activating emotions like humor, awe or joy is essential to our wellbeing. And breaks are the perfect moment to do so. Use your favorite uplifting song, or share some jokes with a labmate. We can also get an extra motivation boost if, just before coming back to the task at hand, we remind ourselves about our larger purpose. Lunch. Although snacking/eating during breaks is not as crucial as other factors mentioned above, we still need nourishment to function at the best of our ability. Thus, skipping lunch to continue working is not an option. It is actually the perfect opportunity to put in practice many of the other tips we\u0026rsquo;ve seen: if possible, have lunch socially (especially, with people you like), away from the office/lab\u0026hellip; you can even do it in a nearby park or under a tree, if you have one nearby. Do not let this opportunity to feed yourself, physically and mentally, pass unnoticed! Naps. The science of napping effectively could itself occupy a whole post. Here, just the highlights: napping has a host of benefits, from increased alertness, attention, memory, reasoning and problem solving capacity (plus the physical benefits like better immune system and health). Length-wise, shorter \u0026ldquo;power naps\u0026rdquo; of 10-25 minutes are most efficient, as they pack most of the benefits and avoid post-nap grogginess. The \u0026ldquo;after lunch dip\u0026rdquo; in attention that most people experience (see our previous chronobiology post) is probably the most natural moment to nap. Also, there seem to be benefits to the regularity of napping (e.g., doing it every day, rather than only occasionally). If you are into caffeinated beverages, some people like the \u0026ldquo;nappuccino\u0026rdquo;, in which you take a coffee just before the (short) nap so that, when you wake up from it, you get the alertness benefits of both the coffee and the nap (caffeine takes about 20 minutes to kick in). Yet, despite all the (average) benefits of napping, be careful with these siestas if you are prone to insomnia or have trouble sleeping (as naps decrease adenosine pressure on our brains, which is critical to fall sleep at night11).  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSummary of the post ideas\n\r\r\rPhew, that was a lot of information! I hope this intense tour of the science of resting and recovering from work was useful. Yet, do not overthink it, or try too hard to have \u0026ldquo;the perfect break\u0026rdquo;: probably this, like many other things in life, is an issue of \u0026ldquo;diminishing returns\u0026rdquo; (20% of the tips and tricks I mentioned will get you 80% of the benefits of a good break). Worse, the obsession with tuning your breaks can become yet another source of procrastination.\nSo, if you have been working hard for 25 minutes, an hour, or whatever time you had set for yourself, get off that chair. Take \u0026ldquo;a short walk outside with a friend during which you discuss something other than work.”1.\nYou can thank me later.\nDo you have any other \u0026ldquo;break tips\u0026rdquo; that have worked for you, which you would like to share with fellow PhD students?

In the continuation of last week\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;study report\u0026rdquo;, we discuss how different kinds of supervisor support relate to those motivational factors and, eventually, the finishing of the doctorate. We will also see how supervisors could foster these motivational aspects and help their students complete the PhD.\nExpanding the general model of PhD completion with supervisor support As we saw in last week\u0026rsquo;s post, researchers have used self-determination theory1 (SDT) to understand the motivational factors that lead some students to finish their PhDs, and so many others to drop out of it. In a nutshell, SDT posits that we are much more motivated to do something if we have autonomy, competence and relatedness in that task. We also saw the results from studies done in Belgium2,3,4, where researchers found three factors that influenced students\u0026rsquo; intention to persist and completion of the PhD. These important psychological factors are: the perception of one\u0026rsquo;s own progress towards the PhD, our emotional exhaustion, and how much we appropriate the PhD research project (i.e., consider it our own). Finally, we saw that there are five different types of doctoral students (in terms of how much their basic SDT needs are covered). For each of these five profiles, progress, exhaustion and appropriation related to completion differently.\nYet, doctoral completion and all these motivational factors do not just depend on a PhD student\u0026rsquo;s actions. Our environment, and especially our supervisors, can also play a big role in whether those needs are met. I suspect that this is the main reason why I completed my PhD, even if some of the correlates of doctoral attrition were playing against me: my supervisors, and the larger research lab where I did my PhD, provided plenty of these needs, in my case.\nWhat kinds of supervisor support are most helpful to foster these student motivational variables (progress, wellbeing and appropriation)? In the Belgian study4, they study three broad kinds of supevisor support3:\n Providing structure (in the form of concrete goals, regular rhythms, advice on how to plan effectively or how to face the inevitable obstacles of research). This is related to how doctoral students can progressively improve their competence. Being involved in the thesis project and the student’s development (e.g., providing emotional support, warmth and respect to the student). This can help with the feelings of relatedness. Supporting the student\u0026rsquo;s autonomy (e.g., letting the student voice opinions and define the direction or implementation strategy of the thesis project). This could help students make sense and appropriate their doctoral thesis.  Using the data from the study, we can thus expand the general model of doctoral completion we saw in the previous post, as shown below:\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA general model of PhD completion\n\r\r\rFrom the model above, we can already get some practical ideas as PhD supervisors. The most efficient strategy is to look for the \u0026ldquo;thickest path to completion\u0026rdquo;. It seems that providing structure not only supports progress the most (which is the most important student psychological factor). It also helps with exhaustion and (paradoxically) with appropriation. Research by the same authors suggests that this is especially relevant at the beginning of the PhD5. Hence, as a supervisor, I would look at the post on how to foster progress in PhD students, and brainstorm clearer structures and rhythms that may support them in advancing and appropriating their theses, without excessive distress (be it with more regular meetings or feedback, or clarifying expectations and goals that might be fuzzy at the moment).\nHowever, since these support strategies have additive effects, I would not neglect the other two completely. In fact, it would make sense to talk to diagnose first. I would try to find out whether my doctoral student\u0026rsquo;s needs are covered, so that I can give more targeted support, as explained below.\nSupporting different doctoral students to complete One of the most interesting parts of this study is where they investigate the role that supervisor support seems to play in the completion each of the five “types of PhD students” (according to their motivational profile). The resulting, more specific models are summarized in the figure below:\n\r\r\rModels of supervisor support to PhD completion according to student profiles\n\r\r\rHow can supervisors best support each type of PhD student?\n Supervisors of globally satisfied students should focus on providing structure (e.g., clear goals, regular rhythms, etc.), as it influences positively both their progress and appropriation of the thesis. Structure also seems to help diminish emotional exhaustion. As we saw when talking about supervising for progress, the main role of the supervisor may be to remain aware of (and help remove) avoidable obstacles that these highly-motivated students encounter in their doctoral journey. In other words, to help students keep the “progress loop” going. Supervisors of competence deficient students should pay especial attention to structure as well. Secondarily, they can pay attention to supporting autonomy (which influences heavily the thesis appropriation in these particular students). The link between intention to persist and actual completion in these students is not so strong, which may signal external factors at play. As supervisors, we could investigate and give advice about these external factors (if we can). We can also target their \u0026ldquo;competence gaps\u0026rdquo;: find which research tasks they are having most trouble with, and advice or support students in acquiring them. Supervisors of poorly connected students should again focus on providing structure, which influences strongly both progress and exhaustion in this type of students. Supporting autonomy may also help appropriating the thesis project, but this factor is less influential than progress. Although the original study does not mention this, as supervisors we could also delve into why their relatedness is so low, and support students in this regard. Is it because of internal strife and bad atmosphere in the lab/research group? Is it the lack of a local research group? Insufficient connections with external researchers in the same topic? Etc. Supervisors of autonomy deficient students should support the student\u0026rsquo;s autonomy, since it strongly influences the appropriation of their thesis project (which in turn relates tightly to both intention to persist and completion). Enabling the student to voice opinions and take decisions about the direction or process of the PhD is essential when supervising these students. Still, offering useful structure also seems to have noticeable effects on the appropriation (as well as the perceived progress) of these students. Supervisors of globally dissatisfied students have the trickiest job, but also are the ones with highest chances of influencing their students\u0026rsquo; psychological variables. Providing supportive structures (clear goals, procedures, rhythms in the research) seems to relate strongly to the student\u0026rsquo;s perceived progress, exhaustion and appropriation. Supporting student autonomy was also related to these students\u0026rsquo; appropriation of their thesis. Yet, focusing on structure should probably come first. In these students, the link between the intention to persist and actual completion are the weakest, which again may hint at external factors that need to be unearthed and addressed. The authors of the study note that this profile should be detected as early as possible during the PhD, to avoid the student lagging too far behind in their doctoral process.  The picture below summarizes the areas and practices that supervisors should focus on, once they know the profile of their PhD students:\n\r\r\rMain areas of focus for supervisors of different PhD student profiles\n\r\r\rCaveat lector All the usual caveats apply to the models and advice above. These are probabilistic models, average relationships\u0026hellip; not certainties. These models come from a study in Belgian universities (which have particular rules, institutional supports and local cultures). Many other demographic, socio-economic and contextual factors may also play a role in students\u0026rsquo; chances of completion, and there are always outliers and random events that can crash the PhD process\u0026hellip; or lift it when everything seemed lost.\nYet, from my own experience as a PhD student, I can say that supervisor support is critical. Having a structure and a rhythm of talking with my supervisors, having the feeling that I could make choices about my PhD process, and knowing that I could count on my supervisors to talk things over if I got stuck (and that they cared about me and about the research)\u0026hellip; made all the difference when problems or rejections hit me.\nYes, in the end I made my own choices and I finished my PhD. But these conditions made all the difference.\nGood luck. And take care.\nI am still quite new at giving supervisors advice. Were these models and practice ideas useful for you as a doctoral supervisor? Did they give you an insight into the choices and dilemmas your supervisor is facing (if you\u0026rsquo;re a PhD student)?

Some of them are external and largely uncontrollable (like financial or family problems), while others relate to our thesis project and motivation. In this new type of blog post (the \u0026ldquo;study report\u0026rdquo;), I dive into the results of a recent research study that defines five types of doctoral students, in terms of their motivational profile. Based on this study, I suggest psychological factors and concrete practices to focus on, to improve our chances of completing the PhD.\nWhen I think how blindly I went into my PhD (with little idea about what research was, no funding, and no experience of the research field I was getting into), I still marvel at the fact that I was able to finish. Many of the known factors for dropping out of a PhD were playing against me. Yet, as we saw in a previous post, we can finish a PhD if our basic needs for autonomy (having a say over the research direction, or how to perform it), competence (feeling able to succeed in the research tasks) and relatedness (feeling part of a research team or community) are covered.\nThese ideas came back while I was reading a recent study, in which Belgian researchers asked N=461 doctoral students to fill in several questionnaires throughout a period of two years. Using these data, the authors tried to tease out the role of these different motivational aspects (and of supervisor support, see the next post), in the completion of their PhDs1.\nHow to complete the PhD: a general model DeClerq and colleagues used self-determination and basic needs theory, refining the theoretical model through the data from five waves of questionnaires. The result was the following model of important motivational factors for PhD completion2:\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA general model of PhD completion\n\r\r\rThe left column of boxes should be familiar to readers of the blog. As we saw in a previous post, the perception of one\u0026rsquo;s own progress in the PhD, the absence of excessive emotional distress (or exhaustion), and the thesis project making sense to us (appropriation), are critical in distinguishing between PhD students that complete and those who drop out of the PhD3. Progress, exhaustion and appropriation, in turn, influence doctoral completion (directly and through our conscious intention to persist on finishing the thesis.\nWe can already draw some practical advice for PhD students from this general model:\n If I were a PhD student, I would focus first on the \u0026ldquo;thickest path\u0026rdquo; to completion. It seems that perceiving steady progress is the strongest factor (both on our intention to persist and directly on completion). Hence, I would read about cultivating the \u0026ldquo;progress loop\u0026rdquo;, and implement one or more of the practices mentioned there. Indeed, I still do those myself, long after my PhD finished. I would also have an honest talk with my supervisor(s) about my progress, and the main milestones, indicators and obstacles to stay on track. Exhaustion is an odd factor in this model, as it affects increases the odds of completion (!?), but also diminishes them (through the intention to persist). I am not sure how to interpret this\u0026hellip; maybe both effects end up balancing out, meaning that many people manage to finish, regardless of exhaustion?4 The model also shows that these factors are cumulative, so none of them should be totally ignored! For example, appropriation may not have the strongest effect, but if we neglect it completely (e.g., just following orders and not trying to make sense of the thesis project for ourselves), it will substract both from our intentions to persist and complete the PhD. Still, this model helps us prioritize our efforts in different areas.  Five types of doctoral students (motivational profiles) But, wait, I hear you say\u0026hellip; where are those competence, autonomy and relatedness that I mentioned at the beginning? According to DeClerq and colleagues, the PhD student\u0026rsquo;s perception of how much those needs are covered, define distinct student motivational profiles. These \u0026ldquo;types of PhD students\u0026rdquo;, in turn, have significantly different relationships between the factors in the model. Each profile had a different set of \u0026ldquo;arrow thicknesses\u0026rdquo;, so to speak.\nWhich were the five types of doctoral students that the Belgian study found?\n Globally satisfied PhD students think things are generally OK. They had higher-than-average satisfaction of competence, relatedness and autonomy needs. For these students, the roles of progress, exhaustion and thesis appropriation worked pretty much like in the general model above. Competence deficient students doubt the quality of their work, and their ability to finish the doctorate. They had average (or higher) satisfaction of their autonomy and relatedness, but much lower perception of competence. For these students, progress had an even stronger influence on the intention to persist, which had stronger weight into completion. In other words, the \u0026ldquo;thickest path\u0026rdquo; through progress got even thicker. Poorly connected PhD students feel isolated, or don\u0026rsquo;t get along with their research team. They had average (or higher) satisfaction of their autonomy and competence, but much lower perceptions of relatedness in their PhD. For these students, we also see progress as a stronger influence in the intention to persist, which itself has a very strong influence on completion (once they set their intention to persist and complete, they seem to be less affected by random/external factors). Autonomy deficient students feel they cannot voice opinions or influence the development of their PhD. They had lower than average satisfaction of their autonomy needs, but average (or higher) competence and relatedness. For these students, thesis appropriation was the strongest factor influencing the intention to persist and the final completion directly. In other words, the \u0026ldquo;thickest path\u0026rdquo; for them was different than for other profiles. Globally dissatisfied PhD students see problems in all three areas. They had lower than average perceptions of their doctoral-related competence, relatedness and autonomy. For these students, the \u0026ldquo;thickest path\u0026rdquo; is again going through steady progress. Interestingly, the intention to persist in these students had a weaker influence on completion than in other profiles. This could suggest that external factors (e.g., a difficult personal or economic situation) are tipping the scales against the students\u0026rsquo; best intentions to persist.  \r\r\rSpecific models of PhD completion according to student profiles\n\r\r\rWhat kind of PhD student are you? What should you focus on? The profiles in the study were determined using the Doctoral-related Needs Support and Needs Satisfaction (DN-2S) questionnaire5. To calculate ours quickly, we can rate ourselves intuitively (on a 1-5 o 1-10 scale) on these three questions:\n Competence: How confident are you in your ability and progress to finish the PhD? Autonomy: How much do you think you have a say in the direction and development of your PhD project? Relatedness: How well do you get along with (or feel integrated in) your team/lab?  If we want a more reliable measure, we can take a look at the paper describing this scale, answering the questions in the \u0026lsquo;Needs satisfaction scale\u0026rsquo;6.\nOnce we know what is our motivational profile right now (note that it may change over time!), we can get an idea of what areas to focus on going forward. If we do not fall clearly into one of the five profiles above (e.g., all our values are average), we can apply the general model and practical tips above.\n If we are globally satisfied, but especially if we are competence deficient or poorly connected, we should focus on ways of making and better perceiving progress in our PhD. It would also help to talk explicitly with our supervisor(s) about how to make our progress more visible, or how to define intermediate milestones so that these \u0026ldquo;small wins\u0026rdquo; slowly convince us of our competence. In the case of the poorly connected, finding ways to meet and talk with other researchers (at your doctoral school, or in conferences and scientific events of your field), would probably help as well (the Belgian study did not delve into this aspect). If we are globally dissatisfied, our situation is the most urgent, and again our first priority should be progress . Maybe here I would first look for concrete obstacles blocking our advances, and define (and execute!) very concrete actions we can take to remove them (rather than just ruminating about the problem). These actions will probably include talking with our supervisor(s) about those obstacles (and whether they can remove them for us, or give us ideas about how to do it) and other ways to foster progress. If we are autonomy deficient, we should focus more on making sense of our thesis project. We can do exercises like the [CQOCE diagram](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/cqoce-diagram/ or the map of the thesis, and discuss them with supervisors and colleagues. We can also try to make the PhD project really our own (e.g., taking a more active role in steering the project, or using the \u0026ldquo;job crafting\u0026rdquo; technique I mentioned in a previous post about purpose).  \r\r\rMain areas of focus for different PhD student profiles\n\r\r\rCaveat lector All the usual caveats of transferring findings of social sciences studies to one\u0026rsquo;s own situation, apply. These models are probabilistic, and there are external factors (not included in the models) which could affect you particularly. Further, this research was done in two universities in Belgium \u0026ndash; so the models may look quite different if you are doing your PhD in a place with different cultural and doctoral program conditions. Also, I did not mention here the supervisor support factors that the authors included in their study\u0026hellip; because that is the focus of the next post.

Motivational profiles and completing the PhD (Study report)"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"In a previous post, I mentioned that uncomfortable emotions (like guilt, anxiety or indecision) are one of the most common obstacles to productivity that our PhD students report. In preparation for a longer series of posts on \u0026ldquo;emotional first aid for the PhD\u0026rdquo;, I have found a short mental exercise that has helped me face those difficult emotions lately. Here it is, in the form of a card-based \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantra\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen I wrote about the productivity challenges faced by PhD students in our doctoral workshops, I mentioned the surprising realization that many students had, about the big role that difficult emotions had in their lack of productivity:\n The most common ones were anxiety (e.g., “I don’t have enough time to finish my thesis”) and different forms of fear: fear of criticism by supervisors, fear of not doing the correct thing. Others reported a paralyzing indecision (e.g., when facing multiple courses of action that seemed equally valid). There were mentions to frustration, especially after an experiment gives bad or inconclusive results. Other common emotional hurdles to productivity are guilt (especially, after engaging for a while in [procrastination]) and boredom in the face of difficult or tedious thesis-related tasks.\n Although I left the doctoral phase behind more than 8 years ago, I still can relate. Totally. The other day, while I was preparing the materials for one of the courses I\u0026rsquo;m teaching (about scientific writing), I was assaulted by a rush of anxiety about a recent meeting with one of my PhD students. I spent the best part of a pomodoro ruminating1 about whether I was providing the right kind (and amount) of guidance to the student.\nThis was not an isolated episode. No matter what stage we are in our research career, we still face emotions like fear (e.g., of letting your university down when you desist in submitting a funding proposal), guilt (e.g., when declining to review a paper for a journal, even after determining that doing so would cave into self-care and family time), etc.\nTo deal with those everyday occasions in which difficult emotions threaten my productivity and peace of mind, I have recently picked up a really simple but profound practice. This exercise is inspired by a short episode/meditation of the Ten Percent Happier podcast, led by Joseph Goldstein.\nI am \u0026hellip; In these moments of anxiety, boredom or guilt, we are just immersed in the emotionally-tinged thoughts. For some, this takes the form of an internal monologue in which we are telling the story of e.g., what we are fearing, or how it will evolve into some kind of catastrophe. For others, it is a series of images of past events or future scenarios. It is like we are in a cinema, watching a movie, when the movie is really engaging and everything else disappears. We are in the story of our guilt, anxiety or boredom.\nYet, sometimes (and this gets easier with practice), we notice this state of mind. We take a tiny step back and realize that we\u0026rsquo;ve been watching this movie (or hearing this internal monologue) for the past 15 minutes \u0026ndash; instead of doing the task we wanted to do.\nI\u0026rsquo;m anxious. I feel guilty. I am bored.\nIn my experience, immediately after this realization, our brain conjures again all the reasons why we should be anxious or guilty or bored and\u0026hellip; we are back to the movie, to the monologue, for the next stretch of time. There is something about such \u0026ldquo;selfing thoughts\u0026rdquo; (about I, me, myself and mine), that keeps us in these emotionally-difficult thinking loops.\nBut this moment of recognition of our own mental state can also be a critical turning point towards more productive thinking patterns. Once we give the tiny step back and think \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m frustrated\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Hmm, I am scared\u0026rdquo;, we can try the following shift\u0026hellip;\nI am There is\u0026hellip; Just shift the thought from \u0026ldquo;I am X\u0026rdquo;, to \u0026ldquo;There is X\u0026rdquo;.\nThere is anxiety. There is indecision. There is fear. There is guilt.\nNo need to describe about what, or why. Just \u0026ldquo;There is\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nThis simple shift of thought puts us into a sort of \u0026ldquo;observer mode\u0026rdquo;. It helps us distance ourselves even more from the unproductive story-making mind (what is called defusion2 in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). This observer mindset makes it easier to turn to these thoughts and feelings with curiosity (not rejecting them or lashing at ourselves for having them). We can recognize how the feelings are felt in the body (\u0026ldquo;Hmm, there is this tightness in the chest\u0026rdquo;), or in our breath (\u0026ldquo;There is a lightness of breath\u0026rdquo;). In this, more rational, frame of mind, we can then decide what we want to do, what is more important in our life: sitting there engrossed in the catastrophizing thoughts, or doing the task we intended to do. And, as we did with the \u0026ldquo;sitting with uncertainty\u0026rdquo; exercise, we can continue doing the work, if we so decide3.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA Monday Mantra card for facing uncomfortable emotions while working in the PhD\n\r\r\rMake it a practice This will not work every time. Heck, most of the times, we will not even notice we are anxious or bored. We will just be, and our brain will be churning out stories or movies about that. Especially, at the beginning. But, if we manage to give that first step back and recognize we are feeling something uncomfortable, we can try the shift to observing the feeling. Of breaking the loop. Slowly, we will build the habit (or the muscle) of emotion recognition. Having a physical reminder (like the card above) on sight in the place where we work, might help too.\nTry it for two or three weeks, and see if the emotions that kept you from being productive slowly recede, or become less compelling. They will always be there, from time to time\u0026hellip; the question is whether we can live with them, and still do what we want to do in our lives.\nBack to my original example, that is exactly what happened to me. The following evening, while talking with my partner at home, my mind wandered off again into the \u0026ldquo;am I supervising right?\u0026rdquo; rabbit hole4. And again the next morning, while doing my stretches\u0026hellip;\nI am ruminating again\u0026hellip; There is rumination\u0026hellip; Feel the muscles stretch, the breathing\u0026hellip;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s OK\u0026hellip; Thanks, brain, for trying to protect me by bringing this to mind.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;ll continue doing what I was doing.\nDid you try out this short exercise to deal with uncomfortable emotions at work?

Yet, I would suggest making an actual task of the thinking.

As PhD students, we often have to juggle different identities, priorities, jobs, projects… along with doing the thesis itself. Yet, so often, it is the thesis-related tasks that keep getting pushed back. In this post, I will go over tips, practices and techniques that might be useful if you find yourself struggling with this particular challenge in your PhD.\nWe all have 24 hours in our day. 1,440 minutes. That’s a lot of minutes… yet most of us feel “time deprived” on a daily basis. For many of us, doing the thesis is not the only important thing going on in our lives: we have to teach classes, or an unrelated research project is paying our salary, or we have to take care of important family issues regularly. Not to mention self-care, from sleeping to exercising or having \u0026ldquo;off time\u0026rdquo; with friends. But, for quite a few PhD students, there is one ball that gets usually dropped in this juggling of priorities and tasks: the thesis.\nIn a previous post, we saw that this common productivity problem originates in the different identities we hold dear (as a doctoral student, instructor, salaried researcher, father/mother, etc.). We also saw a simple way to measure this problem: to log and tally how we spend our time, for a couple of weeks. And then, compare it with the relative importance that we assign to those different areas of our life.\nAside: We may be tempted to gloss over that task above and try to reconstruct our past two weeks from memory. That does not work well (the result will reflect more our tendency to wishful thinking or baseless self-flagellation, than actual reality). Think of it like trying to fix our finances on the basis of how much we imagine/remember we spend on things\u0026hellip; rather than the actual expenses in our bank\u0026rsquo;s account statement!\nThis \u0026ldquo;time spent statement\u0026rdquo; already gives us an idea of whether there are parts of our activities that we regret, that take an amount of time disproportionate to how important they are for us. If I spent 20 hours this week on Netflix and 10 hours on my thesis… is it because watching shows is twice as important for me as finishing my PhD?\nNow we have detected some time-importance imbalances (e.g., \u0026ldquo;I want to spend more time on my thesis research\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;I spend too much time doing emails and looking at Instagram\u0026rdquo;). What can we do next? Here are a few strategies to try, described roughly in the order I’d try them:\nGet into the habit of mono-concrete-tasking This is more of a basic, foundational productivity habit for tasks that require concentration and (cognitive) skill. Maybe in other areas of our life we can get by doing multiple things at the same time (I personally like hearing podcasts while I do household chores)\u0026hellip; But that seldom works in thesis-related activities. The brain does not really multitask\u0026hellip; it switches back and forth between the things we do \u0026ldquo;at the same time\u0026rdquo;. What happens when we try to write a paper and occasionally check our email? The brain has to repeatedly \u0026ldquo;load and unload\u0026rdquo; the 37 concepts we were trying to keep in mind while writing that paper paragraph. In my experience, the results are not pretty: I make errors, I forget things, and only half-baked ideas come through. If you are working on your research, just work on your research.\nAlong with the temptation to multitask, task fuzziness is the other big problem many of us face when trying to work on the thesis. Contrary to other areas of our lives (you cannot get much more concrete than \u0026ldquo;pick kids from school at 5pm\u0026rdquo;), our thesis-related tasks can be wonderfully vague: \u0026ldquo;continue reading papers\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;finish conference paper\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;design experiment\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick test. Look at your to-do list (I assume you have one; and if not, I hope you have a good reason for that :)). Are your non-thesis tasks way more concrete than the thesis-related ones? Can you say clearly how much time each task will take? (e.g., \u0026ldquo;picking up the kids\u0026rdquo; has a concrete length, even after accounting for bad traffic \u0026ndash; but, what about \u0026ldquo;finishing the paper\u0026rdquo;?).\nOur brains are judging our odds of success at doing stuff all the time. If the evaluation turns out positive, we feel motivated to do that; if not, our brains will look for something with higher chances of success. This is why I end up \u0026ldquo;doing email\u0026rdquo; (my brain knows it can \u0026ldquo;do email\u0026rdquo; with high chances of success), rather than \u0026ldquo;coming up with the right theoretical framework for the next study\u0026rdquo; (or whatever my procrastinated task of choice is).\nThus, we need to make our tasks concrete enough, so that we know what are the steps involved (= high chances of success \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; more motivation). That is why the paper writing method I proposed in this blog has 10 very concrete steps. That way, I can transform the big, abstract task of \u0026ldquo;writing a paper\u0026rdquo; into concrete tasks I know I can do. Never allow a task in your main, daily to-do list, unless you know how to do it, and how long it will take. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know, decompose and rephrase them until you do (e.g., go from \u0026ldquo;do X\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;do Y for 1 hour; then do Z for 2 hours; send the result to W\u0026rdquo;).\nWhat is a good technique to get into this kind of mindset and making it stick? You guessed it: the Pomodoro technique. Just do ‘pomodoros’ of your (very concrete) thesis tasks until you finish them. If you are used to multi-tasking on fuzzy tasks, or being not very concentrated while you work, this simple habit of reformulating thesis tasks to be more concrete, and then doing them through pomodoros, will vastly improve your thesis productivity. Even before you dedicate a single extra minute to the thesis.\nTimeblocking: the diagnosis is the prophylaxis Once we got the basics covered (concretization and mono-tasking), let\u0026rsquo;s try something specific for the multiple priorities problem. If we did the \u0026ldquo;time log and tally\u0026rdquo; diagnosis I mentioned above, we have already shifted our mindset from task-focused (how many tasks did I check off the to-do list today?) to time-focused (how much uninterrupted time did I dedicate to the thesis today?). This shift is crucial when we try to apply one of the most powerful productivity techniques for the PhD: timeblock planning.\nIn a sense, timeblock planning is the same as the logging/tallying of our time… but in advance. Basically, to \u0026ldquo;give every minute of our (work)day a job\u0026rdquo;, as productivity author Cal Newport likes to say. I used to run my days from my (often huge) to-do list: once a task was checked off, I looked in the list for the next task (or, more often, I read emails until I found something to do). The idea of timebox planning is that we plan our days, time-wise, and in advance (e.g., the evening before). We assign particular stretches of time to concrete tasks (as if we had an \u0026ldquo;appointment with ourselves\u0026rdquo;). When doing this distribution of time, we take into account, not only existing meetings and appointments, but also the relative importance of different priorities or areas in our life (more importance \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; more time! and don\u0026rsquo;t forget the self-care). Then, we try to execute our day as planned, as this sequence of \u0026ldquo;appointments with ourselves\u0026rdquo;. Whenever we fail to finish what we intended or unexpected changes occur that warp our plans (as they inevitably do sometimes), we create a \u0026ldquo;next best\u0026rdquo; alternative plan for the rest of the day. And then we try to execute it as best we can. Rinse and repeat.\nHow does this look in practice? If one is used to calendar apps (e.g., Google or Apple\u0026rsquo;s Calendar), we can easily create events for our tasks, as we do for our meetings. In my weekly review, I often do a first rough timebox plan for the week (at least, of the big chunks of time needed for important \u0026ndash;not necessarily urgent\u0026ndash; research tasks). Then, I tweak it as needed during the rest of the week. Take a peek below at my calendar for today (and how it looked originally). We could do it just as easily on paper (see the examples from Cal Newport\u0026rsquo;s blog). Really, any random paper notebook will do. The important thing is to always keep the timebox plan at hand, so that we know what to do next (and so that we can make plan changes when we need to).\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rMy original timebox plan for today (left) and how it looked once the day had finished (right)\n\r\r\rI already mentioned timebox planning in passing when talking about avoiding to-do list overwhelm. After implementing it, I have never looked back to a big to-do list. One common benefit I noticed when transitioning to this mode of working is that more \u0026ldquo;deep work\u0026rdquo; got done, even without changing much the time I allotted to my different priorities. I spent less time doing \u0026ldquo;shallow\u0026rdquo;, reactive tasks. Also, it helped me be less of a perfectionist: rather than \u0026ldquo;writing the perfect introduction to my paper\u0026rdquo;, I would try to \u0026ldquo;write the best introduction I can write in two hours\u0026rdquo;. Or, even better, \u0026ldquo;outline the intro for one pomodoro; then write it for the rest of the two hours\u0026rdquo; (concrete tasks, remember?). Plus, as I notice which tasks take longer than I originally expected, I learn how much time different kinds of tasks actually take, and I start to make more realistic plans for my days (I\u0026rsquo;m still not perfect at this, by the way). And a final advantage of timeblocking: it has built-in diagnostics! Now, at any moment, I can look at my weeks, tally up the time dedicated in different areas, apply the \u0026ldquo;regret rule\u0026rdquo;, and try to plan differently next time.\nSeriously, try it for a couple of weeks and see if it works\u0026hellip; you may never have to touch a to-do list again.\nPrevent priority leakage: control your environment Once we are used to mono-tasking and timeblock planning, many of our task conflict worries should be gone. Yet, these strategies may not completely solve the problem. Yes, we have a plan for the day, and we try to execute it, but then something (and email, a call, a message) or somebody comes in and puts tasks in our plates that we did not anticipate. Our nice plan goes awry, as tasks from other priorities leak into the time we wanted to dedicate to the thesis. The way we spend time no longer passes the regret test. And the same happens the next day. And the next.\nHere again, we need to think carefully about our different priorities, separating the grain (those tasks that we want to be interrupted about because they are urgent and important) from the chaff (a random workmate email that is neither urgent nor important). Then, we need to tweak our environment to prevent that unwanted leakage. Classic examples of this tweaking include:\n The biggest culprit of priority leakage is, of course, our smartphone. Learn how your phone notification system works, and de-activate notifications for all but the really important, time-sensitive contacts and apps. When doing timeblocks or pomodoros, use airplane mode if at all possible. Learn how to de-activate email notifications (and any other desktop notifications) in the computer. If parts of our work really require timely response to emails, we could activate notifications for set periods of time (and double-check with our supervisor/employer what these requirements exactly are \u0026ndash; and negotiate!). Again, we need to ensure we de-activate notifications when timeboxing/pomodoring. Personally, I’ve lived without email notifications for a decade now, and it has never led to really important problems. If the leakage is rather caused by people physically interrupting us as we work, we can try adding signals to others during our focused periods (e.g., the classic ‘do not disturb’ sign). We can also change our physical context completely, by going to work someplace where people will not interrupt us: a nearby park, university library, etc. Once this becomes a habit, the mere act of going to the “deep thesis work setting” will put us in a state of focus almost instantly, as the brain learns to associate that particular space with uninterrupted work (this happens to me in our university’s library, for instance).  Change the \u0026ldquo;time spent mix\u0026rdquo;… or reduce scope and expectations Once we regularly mono-task and timeblock without priority leakage, we know our thesis-related time is well spent. If we still regret some of the time we spend in other activities, or notice a lack of progress in the thesis, there is only one major lever left to pull. Progressively increase the time(blocks) allocated to thesis work.\nA good moment to try this conscious shift is during our “weekly review”. Once we place our “basic blocks” in the calendar (sleep, self-care and exercise, unavoidable commitments), we put more (or longer) blocks related to the thesis (remember, assigned to concrete tasks!) than we had last week. Of course, that will mean less time for our other projects and priorities, so it will be tricky. Do not just pile up 12-14 hours of work a day, that is not sustainable for the length of a PhD!\nThis is also a good moment to think whether all those projects are really essential, or rather “nice to have” (or a nice favor to others). If we are in this problematic task conflict situation, maybe we need to drop the less important of those other projects (at least temporarily), if we want to see good progress on our thesis.\nWhat if all priorities are essential? What if there is literally no way to reduce the time spent on them? First of all, I’d think it over again more deeply (we tend to jump to this conclusion too fast). We can talk about it with family or close friends, and try all the other tricks in our decision-making process. Once we are sure there is really no way we can put more time on the thesis in a sustained manner (I’ll say it again, long hours are not a long-term solution, and a thesis is long), it is time to have a serious conversation with our supervisor(s) about the situation. But not an abstract conversation \u0026ndash; a very concrete one! By now we have hard data on how much time we spend on the thesis. Say it out loud: “look, I’ve tried W, Y and Z, but I find it impossible to dedicate more than X hours a week to the thesis”. Once the fact is on the table, we can problem-solve together with our supervisors: Are there other strategies that could work? Is there a way to make scientific contributions of the kind we want to make, spending this kind of time? How long will it take to complete the thesis at this rhythm?1 Can we reduce the scope of the thesis without making it pointless? Maybe our supervisors have ideas for research tasks or studies that are in our original plan, but are not essential for a thesis to be finished. Maybe there are alternative ways of doing the research that are less effort-intensive but still valid. Maybe they will find it unacceptable. Maybe a change in the supervisory team is needed. Having our thesis plan and CQOCE diagram at hand during this conversation will be very useful to ground the conversation and draft potential alternatives. It will be hard, but this conversation will at least unearth problems and set expectations. It will avoid later (and stronger) disappointments.\nOther tweaks to try The tips above will probably have the most impact on our PhD productivity in the face of task conflict. Depending on our particular situation, we can also get a moderate boost by:\n Managing our energy and attention, not only our time. So far, we have talked about the amount of “time spent” on our priorities and the thesis, not about when that time is spent. As we saw in the chronobiology post, we are not equally effective at all times of the day. Therefore, if we can shuffle around the timeblocks of our different projects/priorities, it pays to move our thesis work to the times when we are most productive and focused. For instance, I try to do my deep research-related work in the mornings, which is my high-focus, high-energy time. What is done first… is done for sure. This is a corollary of the previous one. Our energy, attention, willpower and focus seem to be a finite resource (cf. the notion of \u0026ldquo;decision fatigue\u0026rdquo;). Hence, if we find that important thesis tasks are difficult (as they often are), doing them first may be our only way of ensuring that they are done at all. This is also called \u0026ldquo;granny\u0026rsquo;s rule\u0026rdquo; in some circles, from the ancient custom of grandmothers to have children eat their carrots before they have a right to eat their dessert. So wise, grandma. Get into the habit of doing the most important (not necessarily the most urgent!) thesis tasks before doing anything else. How to recognize these tasks among our overflowing to-do list? The tasks that we keep postponing, the ones that make us uneasy because we are not sure how (or if) we can pull them off\u0026hellip; those are often the most important. But we can also double-check with our supervisor! Balance regularity and length/depth. Timeblock planning incorporates the assumption that one needs an amount of uninterrupted time to make progress on something (especially if it is hard). Thus, when timeblock planning, we must be aware of the length of the blocks we assign to the thesis. I\u0026rsquo;d say 60 to 90 minutes is the bare minimum needed to get a difficult research task into my head. More often, 2-3 hour blocks are needed to make noticeable progress in them. Thus, we can try to target those block lengths when planning our thesis work. What happens if those long blocks are rare, and we do not have a lot of control over our schedule? Then we hit another problem: regularity. The more time it passes between one thesis-work block and the next one, the harder it will be to bring all the needed concepts and ideas to mind and make actual progress. Conversely, when we work on a set of ideas for a long time several days in a row, it becomes effortless to get \u0026ldquo;into the task\u0026rdquo;. We may have to balance regularity and depth, e.g., making sure we have at least one longer block of thesis work a day, for as many days in the week as possible. In this sense, having regular times for our thesis work (\u0026ldquo;every day at 10am is thesis time!\u0026quot;) may also help, if we can organize our schedule that way. Use physical reminders to quickly load the thesis context. Related to the previous one, we can exploit particular physical artifacts and visualizations to make the \u0026ldquo;thesis context loading\u0026rdquo; faster. We could have a card with the main research question of our thesis or latest study, visible on our desk (similar to our Monday mantras). Or we could keep a printed copy of our most current thesis CQOCE diagram in our backpack, so that we can take a look at it when we sit at the library for a \u0026ldquo;thesis timeblock\u0026rdquo;.  Review. Iterate. Review. Iterate. One last piece of advice: do not try all the strategies above at the same time! Each of them requires developing one (or more) habits, which may take some weeks to stick and get used to. If we are keeping a journal or diary, we can add a brief note there about whether we stuck to the habit, and what effects we noticed. Then, every 1-2 weeks, we can review whether it worked (hence, we keep the habit), whether we need to implement it in a different way (which is most likely \u0026ndash; some habits take several iterations until we make them work for our particular situation). The goal is not to be perfect at productivity from day one (no one is, ever), but rather to be progressively better at it.\n\r\r\rGraphical summary of the strategies to overcome task conflict\n\r\r\rThat may be the most important part of this post: the incremental improvement mindset. The problems of task conflict are very real, and they are difficult to solve (if they were easy, we would have solved them long ago!). If today we fail, recognize that productivity is a practice, and start again tomorrow. Or start today \u0026ndash; just do a pomodoro! \u0026ldquo;Start again\u0026rdquo; is the key meta-habit to learn.\nNB: In case you are wondering\u0026hellip; no, task conflict does not go away after you become a doctor. In most cases, it becomes worse! It is actually a classic problem of academics, and the main reason many professors are unresponsive to our requests \u0026ndash; they are just overwhelmed by their different jobs and responsibilities. That is why it is very good to start learning how to deal with task conflict in your life, today.\nDid you try these techniques to overcome task conflict and progress more in your thesis? Did they work? Actually, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear pushback against them. Why didn\u0026rsquo;t they work for you? That will push me to think of new tactics, or improve these ideas so that they work for a wider set of people. Don\u0026rsquo;t be shy! :)\nImage by Matheus Henrique azideiadele from Pixabay\n  The formal length of the thesis in doctoral programs assumes that one works full-time on the thesis (i.e., 40 hours a week or so). Many programs have provisions for “half-load” theses (i.e., 20 hours a week) that take twice as long to complete. Yet, if we can only dedicate 10 hours a week to the thesis, many programs will not accept that we spend, e.g., 4x the time (12? 16 years?) finishing the dissertation.

Guess what, you are not alone. In this post, I share the three most frequently-appearing productivity problems voiced in doctoral workshops we have run in Estonia and Spain. I hope this shows PhD students that they are not alone\u0026hellip; and gives PhD supervisors hints about the hurdles their students often face (whether they mention them explicitly or not). Also, I will give a couple of simple rules to know if these are a problem for you particularly.\nGlobal pandemics aside, this past year has been quite interesting in the “A Happy PhD” camp. I have gone from providing advice about the doctoral (and supervisory) journey through this blog, to doing it more directly in workshops and seminars. The workshops touched upon many topics that the readers of this blog may be familiar with: the importance of progress, as well as productivity and mental health advice. I especially liked the doctoral productivity module, where students voiced their struggles about keeping themselves productive. Then, we tried together to come up with techniques, tips and habits to overcome them.\nNow, looking at the evidence and outcomes of the workshops (for research and to improve them), patterns are starting to emerge. The same productivity problems (with variations) appear again and again, even across countries. Below, I describe the three most common productivity challenges mentioned by a total of 48 doctoral students, in four different workshops in Estonia and Spain. Of course, this sample is not representative and the results should be taken with a grain of salt. Yet, I hope they illustrate recurrent issues that appear when talking with doctoral students about productivity (both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic hit).\n#3: Conflicting priorities, projects, tasks… and rabbit-holes One very common category of productivity problems people mention is what I would call “task conflict”: we have to (or want to) do many things, but we only have so much time in a day. The consequence, very often, is that thesis tasks (especially the deep, hard tasks that take a long time) remain undone. There are many variations to this theme: the doctoral student that also has teaching duties (which feel more urgent and leave little time to do thesis stuff); the student that is earning her livelihood through an unrelated 8-hour-a-day job, or through multiple research projects that are not about her thesis topic; the student who has children or other family duties they cannot (and don’t want to) forego… there is even a variation of conflict within the thesis itself, like getting into a “literature reading rabbit-hole” for endless hours, progressively farther from the thesis’s focus (and leaving little time for other important research activities).\nAll these variations have a common feature: they all are conflicts between the many identities or values we hold dear. Being productive in the thesis would be easy if we only valued our research… but we also value having money and food on the table, being a good professional, a good labmate, being a parent, or being a granddaughter. And rightly so. Yet, for many doctoral students, the balance always tips in the same direction: away from important thesis work. Why is that? It seems to depend a lot on our concrete (personal and thesis) situation, and our tendencies1. Some students themselves provided (very accurate) hints about the causes: because thesis tasks seem fuzzy and huge (i.e., lack of clarity on exactly what to do next, or how to do it); because one tends to oblige other people’s requests before our own2; or just because a thesis is no match for a crying baby (your baby), in terms of urgency and importance.\nIn summary, the main problem is, life is complicated. We will always have these conflicts (before and after the thesis). However, it is possible to find a balance. Indeed, many doctoral students successfully do it. Next week, I’ll try to give tips and advice which may help operationalize this balancing act.\n#2: Uncomfortable emotions This productivity challenge surprised me, because difficult emotions were covered in a different module of the workshops. Yet, after some reflection, it strikes me as an unusually insightful and self-aware response to the question of why we are not productive . Many of us identify as obstacles the most obvious symptoms of ‘unproductivity’ (see #3 above, and #1 below). What these doctoral students were able to identify was the “puppet master” behind these unproductive behaviors: uncomfortable emotions, and our brains’ (sometimes unconscious) efforts to avoid them3,4.\nThe emotions that PhD students reported as obstacles to productivity, were quite varied. The most common ones were anxiety (e.g., “I don’t have enough time to finish my thesis”) and different forms of fear: fear of criticism by supervisors, fear of not doing the correct thing. Others reported a paralyzing indecision (e.g., when facing multiple courses of action that seemed equally valid). There were mentions to frustration, especially after an experiment gives bad or inconclusive results. Other common emotional hurdles to productivity are guilt (especially, after engaging for a while in #3 above and #1 below) and boredom in the face of difficult or tedious thesis-related tasks.\nI can easily empathize. I recall many moments during the thesis when I experienced those emotions\u0026hellip; and how they made the idea of working on the thesis quite undesirable. Stay tuned for tips and practices to face them, in following weeks!\n#1: Lack of focus: distractions, interruptions and procrastination The most common category of productivity problems voiced by students in our workshops, were difficulties in focusing or concentrating. This can be surprising to people outside research: for many, lack of concentration is a fact of life (especially, if you have a smartphone in your pocket). Yet, anyone doing a PhD quickly realizes that many research tasks (from reading dense papers to doing rigorous data analysis or communicating clearly in writing) require lots of concentration and skill. A doctorate requires lots of what productivity guru Cal Newport calls “deep work”5.\nThe causes for the lack of concentration, however, are quite varied. For some students, they are mostly external: colleagues interrupting our work (be it for help or random chatter); or family members and flatmates (for those now forced to work from home). Distractors can also take the form of unexpected tasks that veer us away from the main, important (often, thesis-related) ones. Students also mention a lack of focus due to internal causes (what we called ‘self-interruptions’ in a previous post). It could be because one is trying to do too many things at the same time. Or we procrastinate with leisure activities (‘just one more episode of my favorite show’) or work activities (‘I’ll answer these emails, rather than doing the big, hairy thesis task that scares me’).\nIn both internal and external interruptions, the mobile phone is often mentioned. Either because we go to it in our self-interruptions and procrastination, or because it is the channel through which interruptions (by other people, or algorithmically-generated) grab our attention.\nAs you may guess, this kind of productivity obstacle was mentioned even more frequently since the COVID pandemic hit. These days, many students are forced to work from home, or face increased logistic disruptions (from family dramas to public transport shutdowns).\nAre these a problem for me? A simple self-diagnosis Most people I talk to (PhD students or not) recognize themselves in the productivity challenges described above. But, if we all have them\u0026hellip; are they really a problem? Aren\u0026rsquo;t they a “fact of life” that we should accept, then?\nYes\u0026hellip; and no.\nYes, conflicts between our many identities and interests, uncomfortable emotions, interruptions and distractions are a fact of life. Trying to avoid them at all costs (and feeling like a failure when we experience them) is only going to make us unhappy. Yet\u0026hellip;\nNo, that does not mean we should throw our hands up and surrender to the chaos, or become puppets to any interruptions and emotions coming our way. Maybe the question is not are these three problems in my life? (the short answer is yes). Rather, we should ask are these three problems making me live my life in a way that is not in accordance to what I value?, or is the impact of these three problems in my life big enough that it warrants a change in my behavior?. These are more nuanced questions, and you may find it difficult to answer them clearly. Here are two ideas about how you could go about answering them:\n The \u0026lsquo;regret test\u0026rsquo;. This concept, popularized by behavior designer Nir Eyal (in the context of technology design), is simple but powerful. Basically, it is about asking ourselves: do I regret the way I spent my time? (the time I spent in my different conflicting priorities and projects, distracting myself, dealing with interruptions\u0026hellip;). This is difficult to do in-the-moment as we spend our time, but can be answered with a bit of reflection. We could, for example, spend a couple of weeks logging (in a diary, or in a calendar app) how we spend our time. Not up-to-the-minute logs, but maybe in 15-30 minute increments. This is quite easy if we use [the calendar trick mentioned in a previous post](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/ \u0026ndash; but can also be done simply on pen and paper. At the end of this measuring period, I\u0026rsquo;d dedicate one hour to tally up the amounts of time I spent in each kind of activity (e.g., quality time with family or friends, binge-watching Netflix, doom-scrolling in Facebook, dealing with colleague interruptions, writing for my thesis, doing data analysis, etc.). Then, I\u0026rsquo;d compare it with how much I value/prioritize each area of my life6. If the productivity problems above (or other challenges) make me spend a lot of time doing things that are not really important in my life (or little time doing things I value a lot)\u0026hellip; maybe it is time to try and change my habits and behaviors! Frequency and intensity. The regret rule is all nice and good, but\u0026hellip; we all do things we regret, sometimes. We all have weak moments. Another important aspect of these problems is how frequent they are: how often the conflicts, emotions or interruptions make us miss deadlines, are noticeably painful or impede progress altogether. If it is once a semester, I would not fret about it. But, if it is every single day, I would consider doing some changes in how I work. Similarly, you could look at the intensity of the suffering these problems cause. It is not the same to be robbed of 10 minutes of data analysis by our flatmate\u0026rsquo;s interruption, than missing an important formal deadline which risks us getting expelled from the PhD program. As we saw in our introduction to mental health post, many psychologists consider things a problem when a) they are repetitive and uncontrollable; and b) they cause important suffering to us and to those around us. Here, again, I would avoid simply trying to remember the frequency and intensity of the suffering these problems cause (we humans are notoriously bad at such estimations from memory). Rather, I would keep a journal for some weeks, noting down when these problems arise, and how serious were the consequences. Then, tally up, reflect and decide if a change in behavior is needed.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rGraphical summary of the concepts in this post\n\r\r\rIf, after applying the regret test you find that your time spent is not well correlated with how much you value the different areas of your life, if these three problems cause you frequent and intense suffering, then maybe you want to try changing some of the ways you work. In the following posts I will share tips and practices that may help you in doing so.\nIf, on the other hand, your time is more or less aligned with your priorities, good for you! You are probably on the good path, and the occasional productivity glitches you experience are more a consequence of the multiple priorities in your life (some people\u0026rsquo;s lives are much more complicated than others\u0026rsquo;). You may be just experiencing a bit of productivity \u0026ldquo;fear of missing out\u0026rdquo; (FOMO). You can always try to optimize a bit more the way you work (and the next posts will still be useful for you to do so), but do not make a huge project out of it.\nGo on, log and tally these things for a couple of weeks. I’ll wait here\u0026hellip; trying to avoid procrastinating on writing for the blog (a common problem I face these days). I think I will start writing the next post about how to overcome these productivity challenges, right away.\nOr maybe after I make some tea :)\nDo you also experience these productivity problems yourself? Are there other big productivity hurdles you experience, which do not really fall into these categories? Let us know in the comments section below!\nHeader image by Nick Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0 Alpha Stock Images\n  This reminds me of Gretchen Rubin’s model of the “four tendencies”, about how one tends to react to external or internal rules and expectations. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n This is what Rubin calls the “Obliger” tendency… anecdotally, I have noticed many of my colleagues and students, which I would place into this category, often struggle with this particular productivity problem. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Boulanger, J.

In previous posts, we have seen productivity techniques to support us in taking more of these daily steps. Yet, a lot of walking does not necessarily get us anywhere. We need to know that we are actually getting past key reference points, closer to our final destination. In this post, I propose a diagramming exercise to map out key obstacles, milestones and the \u0026ldquo;everyday fuel\u0026rdquo; that propels us past them in our journey towards PhD completion.\nThe idea for this exercise comes from the doctoral and supervisor workshops about progress that we have been doing since 2019, both in Estonia and in Spain. Despite the big distance (geographic and cultural) between these two countries, we noticed a common pattern. Doctoral supervisors that seemed to be \u0026ldquo;on top of things\u0026rdquo; in supporting their students to progress towards completing the PhD, mentioned in passing that they had a clear plan, a \u0026ldquo;map of the PhD\u0026rdquo; that they discussed with their students and helped them know how far they were from the destination. This got me thinking: is there a way we can help PhD students make sense and track their progress at a higher level, a sort of \u0026ldquo;10,000-meter view\u0026rdquo; of the doctorate?\nIn a previous post, I have talked about a diagram that helped me (and many other students \u0026ndash;now doctors\u0026ndash; around my old lab in Spain) to conceptualize, define and refine the main concepts and contributions of the thesis (the CQOCE diagram). Yet, that diagram provides no idea about the process until those contributions come to fruition. And it says absolutely nothing about the biggest risks and pitfalls to watch out for.\nEnter the map of the PhD\u0026hellip;\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rMapping out the PhD\u0026hellip; step by step The map of the PhD will guide us in the long journey through uncertain terrain that is research. Think of it more like a medieval map, rather than a nice, modern map of roads and cities.\n\r\r\rNot the kind of map I\u0026#39;m talking about\n\r\r\rA map of this kind has three types of elements: milestones (reference points), obstacles (places to avoid), and fuel stations (inns and villages where we get the energy and nourishment needed to go from one milestone to the next). Below, I illustrate these elements with examples drawn from the workshops, but keep in mind that:\n We need to come up with our own elements, for our own field, research topic and our own personal strengths and weaknesses. Even if we brainstorm at the beginning many elements of each kind, it is useful to prioritize and simplify the map so that it contains only the 4-8 most important elements of each kind: the ones we need to focus on the most.  The Milestones Brainstorm and select what are the most important reference points in the PhD process. These are events or actions that will happen only once or rarely during the doctorate, which are crucial to know that our thesis is going somewhere. Examples could include:\n to write and present the thesis project, to complete the literature review of the thesis (including a synthesis of the main gaps detected in it), to perform a research/lab process reproducibly, presenting our results at a conference, designing a study that is considered feasible by the supervisors, having your first journal article published, having the CQOCE diagram of the thesis be considered final/stable by the supervisors, completing a draft of the analytical overview (sometimes called kappa) of an article-based thesis, doing a research stay abroad  \u0026hellip; or anything else relevant for our particular thesis. The order of these milestones may or may not be important. The milestones should probably have scientific or learning relevance (rather than being bureaucratic in nature, like the yearly attestation process happening in some doctoral programs, where the contributions/content is not really discussed). Also, try to come up with milestones of different kinds (i.e., do not just put \u0026ldquo;write article 1\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;write article 2\u0026rdquo;, \u0026hellip; etc.).\nHere be Dragons (aka The Obstacles) Again, we can brainstorm and select the most important, concrete obstacles and challenges that might prevent us from finishing the PhD. These can be internal (i.e., related to our particular personality, tendencies, or the nature of our thesis project) or external (i.e., economic or social factors, or unpredictable but probable events that may influence our progress). A nice way of brainstorming these challenges is to do (alone or with a group of fellow students) a \u0026quot;premortem1 of our thesis\u0026quot;. Our initial brainstorm can be pared down to the 4-8 challenges that we deem most likely to happen, catastrophic, or difficult for us to overcome. Example obstacles could include:\n Procrastination (internal) Too much stress or anxiety (internal) Vague or non-existent thesis project (internal) Overwork and burnout (internal) Poor post-PhD outlook demoralizing us (internal) An experiment provides bad results (external) Technical problems in running an experiment (external) Getting too little (or too much?) guidance/supervision (external) Toxic department/laboratory atmosphere (external) A global pandemic cancels our research stay (external)  The Fuel So far, we have been talking about clearly meaningful but infrequent events that either give us a big push forward\u0026hellip; or send us down a cliff. Yet, between these milestones months apart, there is the everyday. The PhD is a long-distance race, and such distances are covered one step at a time, day after day, getting up and doing more of the right things and less of the not-so-good stuff.\nFollowing the medieval journey metaphor, I see these everyday actions as the inns at the end of a day\u0026rsquo;s march, providing a bed and a dinner, which enable us to recover and continue walking the next day. These are much more frequent, often smaller, actions or habits we take on and do every day\u0026hellip; or things we put in our \u0026ldquo;not-to-do list\u0026rdquo;. Be it through doing or not doing them, they help us avoid the obstacles and make sure we hit the milestones. I\u0026rsquo;ll say it again, these can be very personal.\nPeople often focus this \u0026ldquo;fuel\u0026rdquo; part too much on events that they cannot control. That sort of fuel is a sure recipe for getting stranded in the middle of nowhere. An example could be \u0026ldquo;get a paper accepted\u0026rdquo;, as opposed to \u0026ldquo;submit a paper we are happy with\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; the latter being much more under our control. While there can be a certain element of chaos or randomness in getting to milestones, and in the obstacles that pop up on the way, our fuel should be as much as possible under our control (e.g., focusing on our own behavior, rather than other people\u0026rsquo;s actions or judgements).\nAlso, make sure that fuel is frequent enough: daily is best for developing habits, but weekly could also work. If we decide to leave a less-frequent fuel piece in the map, we can think of it as a sort of \u0026ldquo;occasional turbo boost\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; we still need most of our fuel to come from more conventional, frequently-available sources.\nExample fuel items may include:\n (Feedback during) Regular thesis-oriented meetings with supervisors, Discussing our work with external researchers, Writing results reports after each study, Reading research in our area regularly and writing syntheses/reflections about them, Writing new concepts regularly in our lab notebook, Solving particular technical problems, Learning new lab techniques, Writing regularly, Teaching others a method we know, Taking time off with family/friends regularly, Any habits related to exercise, good sleep or nutrition  A few additional notes on the mapping process That\u0026rsquo;s it! Now we have all we need to start mapping out our PhD. Do it using pen and paper, or copy this Google Drawings template I created.\n\r\r\rExample map of the PhD template\n\r\r\rA few more ideas about how I would go about doing it:\n We can do this exercise alone, but it would be even better to do it together with other PhD students in our area/lab/department (that\u0026rsquo;s what we do in the workshops I mentioned at the outset). Every research area (and sub-area, and sub-community) is different. Also, every person is different: we all have different strengths and weaknesses that may play out during the PhD. Hence, even if we do a map together with others, we may want to tweak it for our own particular case later on. No matter how good our initial map of the PhD is, it will probably benefit from suggestions and feedback from colleagues and supervisors (especially, more experienced researchers that have seen many doctoral processes in our area). We could show them the whole map, or just ask a few questions about its elements: what is the most common reason you have seen PhD students fail? what habits helped get you through your PhD? what would you say are the most important milestones in a PhD in our field? Etc. The map is just another tool to help us reflect about the PhD. I would use it sparingly, maybe just at the beginning of the PhD (or in the first meetings with a new PhD student, if you are a supervisor), or in less-frequent reviews and self-reflections (e.g., once a semester). If we focus on this goal-oriented view too much or too frequently, it runs the risk of making us excessively obsessed with the destination\u0026hellip; while the PhD is also a process to enjoy in its own right!  We could take the map metaphor further (what would be the equivalent of alternative routes? or scenic spots? or \u0026hellip;), but this is the simplest exercise I could come up with that still provides a complete idea of the dissertation process.\nJust do it. See if it helps you decide what to focus on for the next stretch of the way.\nDid you try out this exercise? Did you do it alone or with fellow students?

Yet, even if we find them, can we really sustain intense focus during two or more hours? Today\u0026rsquo;s post looks at a research-backed and often overlooked tool in our productivity toolbox: the micro-break. To top it up, I provide two \u0026ldquo;monday mantras\u0026rdquo; to make your micro-breaks even more effective.\nThis past month, it seemed like everyone was writing papers. I was, for sure, and most of my PhD students were as well. In a couple of small \u0026ldquo;writing retreats\u0026rdquo;, I found even more people trying to focus and get some writing done.\nI have written elsewhere about the need to focus on just one thing for long periods of time, in order to get stuff done. Others, like productivity guru Cal Newport, have written eloquently about \u0026ldquo;timeblocking\u0026rdquo; (i.e., separating out considerable blocks of uninterrupted time to work single-mindedly on an important task). This and other related techniques are crucial to get \u0026ldquo;deep work\u0026rdquo; done. Indeed, for a few years I’ve used these techniques myself (along with some chronobiology tweaks), and I have never looked back.\nPersonally, I need an uninterrupted two-hour block (at least!) to move the needle in hard creative/analytical tasks like writing a scientific paper. But\u0026hellip; can we really focus for two or more hours on something? Most of us actually can\u0026rsquo;t1. As a prelude of the next chronobiology post (on the topic of breaks), I will quickly highlight a research-backed, underrated way of making these long stretches of concentration possible.\nEnter the micro-break.\nMicro-breaks What is a micro-break? Put simply, it is a short resting period within the performance of a task (some of the research defines it as spanning less than 10 minutes). Those of you familiar with the \u0026ldquo;pomodoro technique\u0026rdquo;, have already been doing micro-breaks, as it is a series of intervals of 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5 minutes of rest.\nWhy do micro-breaks? Well, because there are a ton of studies that show that these small breaks improve our performance2,3. They enhance our attention4, reduce fatigue3, give us more energy5, and a long et cetera of benefits.\nWhen to do micro-breaks? This is an interesting one. Rather than stopping for a micro-break whenever you feel like it (i.e., whenever your brain decides to self-interrupt), it is probably better to time your breaks (as you do when doing \u0026ldquo;pomodoros\u0026rdquo;). Some studies show that people often self-interrupt for breaks as a way to avoid uncomfortable tasks6. This, however, is not an impulse we want to routinely give in to (in those cases, maybe try the \u0026ldquo;sitting with uncertainty\u0026rdquo; exercise). Whether you set the timer for 25, 35, or 55 minutes, is more a matter of personal preference and, maybe, of the kind of task. Try and find out what works best for you.\nHow to do a micro-break? As several studies have shown, not all micro-breaks are equal2,5,7,8. Breaks that do not seem to provide much benefit include: those involving caffeinated beverages7, having a snack, or cognitive activities like checking your email or your mobile phone8. The micro-break activities that seem to work best include: resting your eyesight by looking at something far away (as in the 20-20-20 technique for breaks), stretching4 or other \u0026ldquo;office yoga\u0026rdquo;. Breathing, meditation or relaxation exercises2,7 also seem to work (e.g., the classic \u0026ldquo;boxed breathing\u0026rdquo;, or the \u0026ldquo;water breathing\u0026rdquo; exercise mentioned in this TED talk). Or simply go for a walk \u0026hellip; e.g., to the fountain to fill your cup with water (hydration is good too!)3.\nThen, to end the micro-break on a high note and regain focus, connect with a positive aspect of the task at hand. How do you do that? Use one of the \u0026ldquo;monday mantras\u0026rdquo; below.\nConnect with your purpose \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rConnect with your purpose at the end of a micro-break\n\r\r\rHaving a sense of ultimate purpose for what we do in the PhD has already featured several times in this blog: as a way to cultivate more happiness in our everyday research work, or when making important decisions about the PhD. Why did you start the PhD, what were you trying to accomplish? Was it about personal development? About getting a better job so that you can provide for your family? Or was it about finding a solution to some problem that people have? Write down in the other side of the card, in the most concrete terms possible, what is your reason, you why for doing the PhD. Some will prefer to paste a photo of those that will benefit, or some other symbol of this reason. Suit yourself.\nBefore coming back to your task, take a look at the card, remember that you are doing the writing for that very good reason. Now, focus back on the work.\nOr\u0026hellip;\nConnect with fun! \r\r\rConnect with fun at the end of a micro-break\n\r\r\rThis is similar to another mantra we gave when the pandemic started. We often look at these focus/writing sessions as a thing to \u0026ldquo;power through\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; as a duty, a necessary evil we need to suffer so that we can get to the other side. And yet, writing (or whatever focus task you\u0026rsquo;re doing) is fun! There are people that do it pretty much for free, as a hobby. Are you sure that you are not, deep down, one of these people that actually enjoy this activity? Once you get into it and forget about all the fears, identifications and extraneous stuff we tend to layer on top of it, isn\u0026rsquo;t writing fun? Yes, it is difficult, but so was the last level of Super Mario\u0026hellip; and yet, it was fun.\nIf the word \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo; does not cut it for you, maybe there is a different positive quality that better describes what the research means for you, be it \u0026ldquo;beauty\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;accuracy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;elegance\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;completeness\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;simplicity\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; The point is to highlight the work itself as something worthy, enjoyable, not just something instrumental we do in order to get something else.\nI have been writing this blog for almost two years now\u0026hellip; do you think I \u0026ldquo;power through\u0026rdquo; writing these blog posts when I sit in a quiet place, put away my phone and put on the headphones? No! Rather than running from the pain of having to do it, I run towards these positive qualities of writing the blog: purpose and fun.\nDo not use these qualities as yet another tactic to self-manipulate.\nDo it because they are truly so.\nDid you try doing micro-breaks more regularly? Do you have other tricks or tactics you use to keep yourself focused for long periods of time? Let us know in the comments section below!\nHeader image by Pikist\n  Helton, W.

If you have noticed trends in when these experiences happen, you have stumbled into the importance of chronobiology for your productivity. In this and following posts, I provide advice on how to organize your research work, based on chronobiology research. Today, circadian rhythms \u0026ndash; i.e., when to do what during the day.\nBy now we know that doing a PhD (or research in general) is hard: writing is hard; giving and receiving feedback is painful; emotional distress and the temptation to abandon the PhD are snares waiting to trip us up at every corner\u0026hellip; There are no certainties in doing a PhD (that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;research\u0026rdquo;, as the old adage goes). Yet, as it happened with the issue of dropping out of the PhD, there are ways of loading the odds to favour our side. Knowing a few basic chronobiology facts, observing ourselves, and rearranging our workday in consequence, can help us be more effective at our craft.\nChronobiology studies timing processes in living organisms, including periodic cycles (e.g., solar, lunar rhythms)1. While there is little research into PhD student-specific chronobiology2, general insights from this field (nicely summarized in books like Dan Pink\u0026rsquo;s When3) can still be very helpful.\nCirc\u0026hellip; what? rhythms The most important chronobiology cycle, and our daily life is… well, the day. You may have heard about \u0026ldquo;circadian rhythms\u0026rdquo;, which are the natural, internal processes that regulate our sleep-wake cycle, repeating roughly every 24 hours. The rising and falling of hormones, neurotransmitters, etc. during these processes, in turn, affects our alertness and our ability to think analytically.\nFor most of us, alertness and ability to focus tend to rise shortly after waking up, reaching their peak in the late morning. Then, in the early afternoon they drop, and later they recover, only to fall in the night again. You can see a rough sketch of this pattern in the image below.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSleep-wake cycle in the general population (green) vs. that of night owls (blue)\n\r\r\rYet, people actually differ quite a bit in the exact times where these peaks and troughs happen (see the blue line in the figure above). Which leads us to chronotypes\u0026hellip;\nFind your chronotype Our chronotype is the particular behavioral manifestation of our circadian rhythm: when do we naturally go to sleep? when do we wake up? when is our usual peak alertness? Chronobiologists often talk about morningness (i.e., naturally getting up very early \u0026ndash; the prototypical \u0026ldquo;morning lark\u0026rdquo;), or eveningness (i.e., the tendency to get up later and stay up late in the night \u0026ndash; the classic \u0026ldquo;night owl\u0026rdquo;). Most people fall into the medium-to-morning part of this continuum. Yet, there is an large minority (15% by some measures) of clear “night owls” among us.\nHow do you know your level of morningness-eveningness? If you want to be rigorous, I recommend taking the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ)4. There is also a simpler heuristic to find your approximate chronotype:\n Think of a \u0026ldquo;free day\u0026rdquo; in which you are not exhausted nor have obligations or appointments (like going to work early, dropping the kids at school, or socializing late in the evening). Like a calm, lazy day in the middle of a long holiday. What time would you naturally go to sleep and wake up in such a day? Find the middle point between those two events. If your midpoint is before 3:30am, you\u0026rsquo;re probably more of a morning lark; if your sleep midpoint is later than 6am, you\u0026rsquo;re a night owl5. Most people will fall somewhere in between.  Set an ideal schedule (for you) With these two pieces of information (the general pattern of alertness and your own chronotype), you can start designing your \u0026ldquo;ideal work schedule\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; as much as your life circumstances allow. Fortunately, many PhD students have quite a lot of leeway in how they can structure their work, compared with other professions!\nA typical morning-to-medium PhD student could do worse than follow this schedule, adapted from that of writer Joyce Carol Oates3:\n Have a longer span of morning work, approximately 8:30am\u0026ndash;1:00pm. In this band, accumulate as much analytical, high-focus work as you can, while your mind is working optimally. Data analysis, paper manuscript editing, research planning, all fit well in this category. Personally, I try to spend at least two hours of uninterrupted focused work in my mornings, before I engage in meetings or email. Recover your energy in the early afternoon, e.g., 1:00pm\u0026ndash;4:00pm. You can do some vigorous exercise or just go for a walk (bonus points if you go in nature, even if it is just a nearby park). Have lunch with friends or colleagues or, if you have to work, place tasks like email, administrative chores or meetings (as long as there are no high-stakes decisions involved). I have now moved my running workouts to this band, to get as much natural sunlight as I can and avoid \u0026ldquo;winter depression\u0026rdquo;. Have another bout of work in the late afternoon, e.g., 4:00pm\u0026ndash;7:00pm. In this band you can do some more relaxed, creative work (our “inner critic” seems to relax a bit by this time). Brainstorming ideas for new studies, or putting out “shitty first drafts” of a manuscript (“step 0” of my paper writing process) fit this band well. Finish up your day with more recovery activities: socializing, hobbies, maybe exercising, or having dinner and enjoying time with your family and loved ones. Disconnect from work completely after an effective workday. Gradually choose calmer activities as the evening passes, to prepare yourself for bed. Avoid screens late in the evening.  What if you are a certified night owl? The schedule above will be hell, as your peak and trough times are shifted by about six hours. Night owls would rather put most of their work in the early afternoon (12:00\u0026ndash;5:00pm), maybe do a pause for dinner and recharging (5:00\u0026ndash;7:00pm) and then do another stretch of work in the late evening (7:00-11:00pm).\nIt is worth mentioning again: we are all different. The best schedule is the one we can actually keep without too much stress (regularity is key!). Keeping a journal and noting down our moods and energy throughout the day, can help understand our particular chronotype and fine-tune our schedule. Personally, I have recently found (after a lot of trial and error) that early morning exercise suits me well, as it boosts my mood for the whole day afterwards.\n\r\r\rSummary of the post’s ideas\n\r\r\rDo you have other ways to structure your day and manage your energy?

In this post, I offer a simple exercise to use next time these internal interruptions assail you during writing.\nLast week I attended a “writing camp” (or “writing retreat”): a small group of PhD students and supervisors got together for a few days, away from the office, to get some research writing done. Most of the time, we were sitting in the same room, doing “group pomodoros”. That was it. Just writing, together. The effects of applying a bit of social pressure and focus techniques on my writing productivity were considerable. But I hear it is even more dramatic for those with jobs, kids and other strong obligations beyond their research.\nInterrupting oneself Still, the paper I’m currently writing was not finished during the writing camp. Hence, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last few days trying to reproduce that level of productivity on my own\u0026hellip; with appalling results. Paradoxically, the problem has not been that I was being constantly interrupted by others. More often than not, I was interrupting myself! Here\u0026rsquo;s a typical example of my internal monologue:\n(… 8 minutes into a pomodoro…)\n– This related work section looks flimsy\n– Yep. Only 10 references? In this high-impact journal they are going to laugh at us\n– Look, laptop battery is at 23%, we better get up and plug it to the AC\n– Coming back to the related work…\n– Hey, just remembered, we have to book the badminton court for Sunday!\n(etc., etc.)\nIt turns out, this is a very common experience (called \u0026ldquo;internal interruption\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;self-interruption\u0026rdquo;1), especially when we do boring tasks or we have low energy levels. Yet, in this case I am writing about a topic that I think is important, about a study whose findings I find exciting! What\u0026rsquo;s going on here?\nApparently, this kind of self-interruption happens when our brains re-assess the current strategy, and whether it is likely to meet our goals1,2. Imagine how our hunter-gatherer ancestors thought twice before running after some deer for today\u0026rsquo;s meal (is foraging for berries more likely to be successful?). Similarly, our brains are doubting whether to continue writing is a good strategy (maybe they will reject the paper after all, and I will feel bad), or whether other strategies will take us closer to our goals (seeing a text from a friend will signal that I am loved, and I will feel good). In summary:\nIt just feels uncomfortable not to know how things will turn out.\nThe problem is, our brains seem to ignore several things that research has now evidence for: that this kind of interruption (and multi-tasking in general) can damage our performance in difficult tasks3; that chronic multitaskers seem to do worse in analytical writing tasks4; or that just the fact of having a distractor (like our smartphone) nearby, already triggers some of this multi-tasking and self-interruptions5.\nWhat can we do when these self-interruptions assault us during writing (or any other difficult task that requires focus)?\nAn exercise on sitting with uncertainty Next time you are writing and you catch yourself doubting whether your prose is good enough, whether the effort is worth it, try the following:\n Recognize. You caught yourself doubting, so you are already in step 1. Simply recognize that you were feeling uncertainty about where this is going, not with the whiplash of guilt (you dumb brain!), but rather with gentle curiosity (hmm, how odd!). Allow. Do not force your attention back to writing right away. Do not dismiss your doubts (writing is difficult and uncertain). Allow the feelings of doubt, of uncertainty, to be there. You could even thank your brain for trying to protect you from \u0026ldquo;danger\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo;. Investigate. For a minute or two, try to delve into the feeling of doubt, of uncertainty. Close your eyes for a moment. Hear your thoughts, what do they say exactly? You can write them down if you have a piece of paper at hand (\u0026ldquo;this related work looks flimsy\u0026rdquo;). Turn your attention to your body, do a quick scan: how does the uncertainty feel? pressure in the forehead? a knot in the stomach? a feeling of low energy? or high-energy restlessness? Do the sensations change as you observe them? Do not reject any of these sensations, just recognize each of them with curiosity (hmm, interesting!). Nurture (others call it Non-Identification). Now that you know what this moment of uncertainty is made of (your brain thinking thoughts, the swirl of body sensations and feelings), you can see that this is not who you are. These are just experiences that happen spontaneously, like an itch, and eventually go away. And these particular sensations tend to happen when we do difficult things\u0026hellip; like writing. Now is a good moment to connect with your why: why are you writing the paper? what is your purpose? I don\u0026rsquo;t mean obvious things like \u0026ldquo;to get a PhD\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; why is the PhD important to you? will it bring a better livelihood to your family? will it help you understand the world better? gain new and exciting skills? will the ideas in your paper help others? Bring to your mind all the wonderful things that will come through you writing this paper. Continue. Now, ask yourself this simple question: what would happen if you continued writing for just one pomodoro? (or until the end of the current one). Why don\u0026rsquo;t you try and see what happens? After that period of focus ends, give yourself permission to stretch, defreeze the fridge, or do whatever you want (although it is a good idea to get some \u0026ldquo;real rest\u0026rdquo;, be it napping, water breathing, or meditating6).  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rGraphical summary of the sitting with uncertainty exercise\n\r\r\rEven if it took you a while to read the steps above, the whole exercise does not need to take up more than a couple of minutes.

And have you ever found afterwards that many of your carefully-crafted, thoughtful comments had been ignored? In this \u0026ldquo;quickie\u0026rdquo; post for supervisors (or for anyone giving internal feedback), I share a small trick that I use lately to avoid these situations\u0026hellip; and get better outcomes for everyone involved.\nDripping with red ink I remember the first time I read this PhD comics strip. I had just received one of my early paper drafts back from my supervisors. When I\u0026rsquo;d sent it to them, I thought it was almost ready for submission. Yet, there they were, several dozen comments in red ink over the paper printout.\nOuch.\nAt the time, I had felt down and discouraged, but at least the comic strip helped me understand that I was not alone. What happened next? I don\u0026rsquo;t really remember, but here\u0026rsquo;s my best guess: I went through most of the comments (especially, the easy ones), and tried to solve them in the quickest way possible. It was just too much emotional and cognitive pain to redo the text that I had so effortfully crafted. Some of the comments, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, I never addressed (maybe consciously, more probably semi-unconsciously). Yet, there is one question that I did not pose myself until years later:\nHow had my supervisors felt when they saw that the next draft still contained some of the same errors?\nMore than 10 years have passed since then. I am now the supervisor of five PhD students (and I have provided feedback to many, many more). From the other side of the fence, now I have the answer: at times, I feel ignored and frustrated. (At other times, let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what comments I\u0026rsquo;d made).\nRecently, I came across a paper showing that this sort of feedback overflow (and ignoring) is quite common1. As supervisors, we too often try to make students\u0026rsquo; papers exactly like we would write them. Or we secretly fear what others will think of us if a less-than-perfect paper goes out into the world with our name attached to it. As students, the deluge of critical feedback is emotionally difficult (or plain confusing). Glossing over some comments is thus one of the subtle mechanisms that our minds have to protect our (already fragile and impostor-syndromey) egos.\nIs there a way to escape this situation in which we give too much feedback that then gets ignored? Can we at the same time avoid breaking doctoral students\u0026rsquo; already \u0026ldquo;fragile shell of success\u0026rdquo;?1 Here\u0026rsquo;s the trick I use lately to counter this situation in my own research and supervision\u0026hellip;\nAn alternative way to give feedback to your PhD students (or peers)  Take a post-it (the normal-sized ones, not the big ones) and a pen. Yes, even if the document is on Google Docs or some other digital platform. As you read, control the impulse of quick-reaction commenting on small details, vocabulary or clumsy figures of speech (tools like Google Docs make this exceedingly easy and tempting). Look for the broad, structural, fundamental problems that break the paper. Or recurrent issues that repeat throughout the text. When you detect such an important issue, write a quick note down in the post-it (not a full sentence, just a bullet-point memory aid) You are not allowed to exceed the space of the post-it (on both sides, if it comes to that). This limits your notes to no more than ten-ish feedback items. Only after you finish reading, you can start writing the actual feedback, based on the post-it notes. The goal is to craft really effective feedback that helps the other person learn and be motivated to move forward. Classic rules for better feedback include:  Be clear and specific (\u0026rdquo;????\u0026rdquo; is not a useful comment). Be constructive. Don\u0026rsquo;t just point out problems (feedback); spend more effort suggesting alternatives, next steps or new ways to think about the text (feedforward)1,2. Never make personal attributions (\u0026ldquo;you are a bad writer\u0026rdquo;). Paint errors as a common and natural part of the learning process (not something to fear)3. Consider the person\u0026rsquo;s current and self-perceived ability. Novices will need more encouragement and feedforward. More advanced writers can probably withstand more direct feedback4 Et cetera. Think what your comment will bring as an outcome, both in making this paper better and making future papers by this person better. How can we help them think and write clearly? If you (like me) never had a proper feedback education, go back and read education classics like Hattie\u0026rsquo;s work3,4.    \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA real example of post-it feedback, from a few weeks ago\n\r\r\rDoing feedback this way helps me revise papers faster, and focuses my energy on the important stuff. What\u0026rsquo;s important? the ideas in the paper and the evidence behind them\u0026hellip; and making my feedback an effective tool to help others learn.\nAt least, I have found this method better than the old giving up, frustrated, after 50 small comments on the first page of a document.\nCautions, caveats and other qualms Using this method requires a change, both in our practice and other people\u0026rsquo;s expectations. It will be hard at the beginning. Also, pay attention when not to use it:\n When giving your feedback, highlight that it isn\u0026rsquo;t all possible comments, just the most important ones. Avoid the false expectation that, once those are solved, the paper is perfect. You could even say explicitly how many iteration rounds you think are left (or use a 1-10 readiness scale). This post-it feedback method works best with internal research reports, or in iterative paper writing processes (like the one I have recommended before in this blog). Do not hold up on feedback about the truly important things, like methodological rigor and other scientific must-haves. If you plan to sign as a co-author, you accept responsibility for what is said in the paper! In summary, use your judgement when deciding if this method is appropriate. It may not be useful in the last revision round of a dissertation (when polishing many tiny details is actually the point).

In this post, I go over a simple pattern to organize more effective meetings when a group decision or proposal has to be made. Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by its simplicity: it\u0026rsquo;s much more effective than \u0026ldquo;business as usual\u0026rdquo; meetings, but people (including ourselves) will resist it fiercely, because it feels unnatural to act against our internalized meeting routines.\nMeetings I hate During my years in academia (and before that, in the industry), I have been to many, many\u0026hellip; many meetings. Some of them were useless from start to finish, e.g., when somebody just wants to communicate something to a group of people that could have been better (and faster) said in an email or document \u0026ndash; you know, those where everyone around the table is just doing their email or Facebook.\nWhat a waste.\nThere is, however, another kind of meeting I find even more unnerving: the meetings where you really need to take a decision, or find a creative solution to a difficult dilemma\u0026hellip; but end up with no decision whatsoever, just taking the first option that came to anyone\u0026rsquo;s mind. These meetings usually go like this:\n (0 mins into the meeting) Everybody arrives to the meeting (if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, on time) from their previous meeting, or lecture, or task \u0026ndash; rather absent-mindedly (their heads still battling with the unsolved problems of the previous meeting). (5 mins into the meeting) There is some informal chat (about recent holidays, or family, or latest news and gossip at the institution), as people ease into being among this new group of people. (10 mins) Slowly, the person who called the meeting or the facilitator (if we are so fortunate that one has been designated) tries to get people\u0026rsquo;s attention so that the actual meeting can start. (15 mins) The facilitator (or someone else) starts a slide presentation about the background information and latest events related to the decision to be made. Sometimes, multiple people have to talk about different aspects of the background of the meeting. This is often the worst-case scenario, as people start discussing whether some small detail of this background is 100% correct. (45 mins) Somebody notices that almost all the time allotted to the meeting has passed and nothing has been decided, so the background presentations are cut off (maybe leaving important information or options out of everyone\u0026rsquo;s mind), in order for the actual decision to be discussed. (50 mins) One person (usually, the one highest in the hierarchy, or the one who most likes the sound of their own voice) talks about the first option that came to their mind, for several minutes. Often, everyone else has had the same idea already, so they start (or continue) doing email. If we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, more than one option is actually spoken about. (sometime 60-90 mins into the meeting) Everybody has to run to their following meetings, so a rushed decision is made: an explicit decision, one would hope – but very often the decision is rather made implicitly (leading to misunderstandings or resentment) or unilaterally by the boss after the meeting ends (which makes the meeting kinda pointless). The decision probably takes the most obvious, unimaginative option that first appeared on the table. Many people have not even had the opportunity to voice their opinion or a single idea.  Sounds familiar? This happens not only in big research projects with many partners, but also in smaller labs, and even in humble PhD meetings, when there are multiple supervisors and/or additional people (be it professors, postdocs or other PhD students) that have been called to weigh in or give an expert opinion about some important aspect of the problem at hand (a practice which I actually recommend \u0026ndash; it is not that all group meetings are bad per se!).\nYet, one cannot help but wonder: Is there a way to waste less time, or at least, to come out of the meeting after really having discussed and considered options beyond the obvious?\nIt turns out there is.\nA more effective meeting pattern This decision-making tip, or “pattern”1 comes from an interview with Daniel Kahneman about decision-making, which is why I sometimes call these the “Kahneman-style” meetings. I am not sure, however, that he invented it, or actually studied its effects in his own research. The problem with many group meetings, he notes, is that people converge on one idea too fast, not giving serious thought to the multiple alternatives available (or generating more options). This is what, in some circles, is called \u0026ldquo;group-think\u0026rdquo;: the fact that we tend to conform with the (apparent) opinion of a group, even if initially we had different, original ideas about the question at hand. In order to avoid such early convergence, Kahneman suggests forcing more individual work, and taking advantage of time outside the meeting. The steps of this new kind of meeting would go like this:\n (one week before the meeting) We decide that a meeting is necessary (is it really?? if there is no creative, important decision to be made, maybe a usual meeting, or an informative email, is enough). Somebody (e.g., the person calling the meeting, or whoever has most background information) starts compiling the background information that people will need to take a decision. The meeting is called, a suitable time/place is decided (e.g., via Doodle), etc. as in a normal meeting. (3-5 days before the meeting) An email is sent to all meeting participants, with the background information (e.g., a report, a series of papers, etc.), an explicit statement about what decision or question the meeting intends to resolve, and clear instructions to the participants: they are expected to go over the background and provide their own initial answers, ideas, options, or solutions \u0026ndash; to be sent just to the coordinator/facilitator before the meeting (tip: set a clear deadline, e.g., no later than two days before the meeting). (2-4 days before the meeting) Everyone who plans to attend the meeting, looks at the material at a time of their own choosing, and reflects about the problem/question at hand. Then, according to the instructions, everyone sends a few answers/ideas/options to the facilitator only. This email does not need to be very lengthy, maybe a few bullet points will suffice \u0026ndash; the point is to capture a wide array of ideas, not to write an essay about each idea. Of course, the facilitator (especially if it\u0026rsquo;s you, the PhD student) also generates his own set of ideas before reading others\u0026rsquo; input \u0026ndash; let your own voice and ideas be heard! (1 day before the meeting) The facilitator compiles the input received from all participants, synthesizing it into a small slide deck or a short report/handout. It is crucial that this synthesis is not very lengthy: fuse ideas that are very similar, and write just enough to get the gist of each idea. Also, leave out who proposed the idea: people will find out eventually, but try to help them judge ideas without the social dynamics and hierarchies interfering. In total, going over this synthesis should not occupy more than 5-10 minutes during the meeting. (0 minutes into the meeting) Everyone arrives to the meeting. There is some informal chat (about recent holidays, or family, or latest news and gossip at the institution), as people ease into being among this new group of people. (Yes, this is the only step that has not changed from the business-as-usual meetings). (10 mins) The facilitator quickly presents the goal of the meeting (in the form of the explicit question/problem that was sent in the preparatory email), and goes over the synthesis of proposed ideas slides created in step #4 (or gives the handouts for people to read individually in silence). Very importantly, this introduction should contain NO background information (if people have reflected and answered about the problem, just looking at the ideas proposed will probably be enough of a memory refresh; if they did not, that’s their problem). Instruct people to abstain from discussing right away: the facilitator can present the options, or let people read the options for a couple of minutes in silence, maybe just asking quick clarificatory questions if any of the ideas is not clear. This is actually very hard, staying silent in a room full of people that have come to talk\u0026hellip; but it is necessary! remember, we are trying to delay early convergence, until we have considered all the options. (20 mins) The facilitator asks for any additional ideas or options that may not be in the synthesis, which may have occurred to participants in the meantime. Then, the actual discussion begins. The facilitator should try to get every person to voice their opinion (even the ones that tend to stay silent, there are always some of those in every meeting). (30-45 mins) At this point, probably opinions will have converged naturally into what the group thinks is the best option. If we want to force the group to consider multiple aspects or criteria for the decision (like costs, feasibility, effectiveness, etc.), we can go over all the options and rate them in every one of the important dimensions, before asking for a vote (similar to the \u0026ldquo;analytic intuition\u0026rdquo; approach I mentioned in a previous post). This vote can be by simple show of hands, or my personal favorite, the \u0026ldquo;heatmap voting\u0026rdquo;, in which every person has a number of votes (e.g., three) to be distributed among the options as they like. The results of the vote can be compulsory to be followed, or just an advisory decision (if the boss or the PhD student has the last word on what to do), but be clear about this before the vote, so that people do not feel betrayed afterwards. (40-55 mins) The facilitator thanks everyone for their time and creativity, and goes with the group over the next steps or tasks to be taken in executing the decision, and who is responsible for each. (45-60 mins) The meeting ends. Everybody leaves with the satisfaction of a job well done, and even with some minutes left to chat a bit more, grab a coffee or do some stretches, before the next meeting or task begins. (After the meeting, ideally the same day) The facilitator (or another designated person) sends all participants a short memo with the decision taken by the group (or by the ultimate decision-maker), the next steps (with deadlines) and their assignment to the responsible people.  That\u0026rsquo;s it. You can see a graphical summary of the method below.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rDiagram of the Kahneman-style meeting process\n\r\r\rAs you may have noticed, this method has a few additional steps, and requires some preparation before the meeting, by everyone involved (and especially the facilitator, which may be you). Hence, I would not use it for every single meeting, just those that are important and require careful consideration and/or creative solutions by a group of people. But, if the topic at hand is not important, why meet at all? Personally, I have used this method several times in the past months to take decisions about an international research collaboration we have, and every time it has worked well: we came out of the meeting in record time, with a decision taken, and the meetings themselves were lively and engaging for everyone.\nThere will be resistance. Heck, probably you yourself will resist doing this, as it has several awkward moments (asking people to send ideas only to you, or staying silent in a room full of people). Resist the urge to go back to your old ways.\nIt is worth it.\nIt may take a few runs for people to understand that this method is really more effective, engaging and participatory. But eventually, most people see that the benefits (being engaged and seeing your opinions considered, rather than doing email during long, pointless discussions) outweigh the costs (reading the background information whenever you feel like it, and writing down a few bullet points).\nDid you try this meeting pattern?

In the continuation to last week\u0026rsquo;s post, we see how to go about the actual decision-making, to choose the option that has the best chances to satisfy us in the long run.\nOK, quick recap from last week: we are facing a difficult situation in our PhD, and don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do, or it seems we have to choose between two undesirable options. In the first phase of my proposed decision process, we expanded our understanding of the situation and the available options: We reflected on our own values and purpose (what is important in life for us); we applied these values/purpose to the PhD itself, to understand what aspects of it we value most (and which are secondary); we found out and talked with other actors in the situation, to understand their motives; we brainstormed more alternatives, to unstuck ourselves from having only easily-available but not-that-desirable options; we used our institution\u0026rsquo;s resources and information to get further help; and we talked with some more people about the situation, to get alternative perspectives and new ideas about potential paths of action.\nAnalyze the options and take a decision By now, we will have in front of us, not one or two, but actually many different alternatives, options and (pieces of) potential solutions to our dilemma. At this point, we may be tempted to throw away most of them, and remain with the initial, obvious 1-2 options that we started with, because the others are just\u0026hellip; unconventional. Resist that urge. Maybe delete those that are clearly impossible, but leave yourself at least a good handful of options that could, maybe, work. Now, its time for phase 2 of the process: analyze the options and take a decision. As in phase 1, here there is also a small piece of meta-advice about how to go about this. The key for good decision making, according to psychologists and other researchers of the topic, is to slow down, if you can: making decisions on a hurry has all sorts of effects, and many of those effects are not positive1. Here is a list of things we can do to improve the actual taking of a decision:\n Try some \u0026ldquo;analytic intuition\u0026rdquo;. Despite all the steps that we took in phase 1 to expand our understanding of the situation, chances are that we\u0026rsquo;ll have to take a decision under incomplete information. In these situations, we often go with our \u0026ldquo;gut feeling\u0026rdquo;, our intuition. In this interview2, Daniel Kahneman (Nobel in Economics and one of the most influential psychologists alive), shares a critical trick when dealing with decisions that are complex and uncertain, learned from his research in decision-making: “Delay your intuition. Don’t try to form an intuition quickly. Focus on the separate points, and when you have the full profile, then you can have an intuition.” So, basically, we need to select different criteria or dimensions against which we\u0026rsquo;ll judge each option: what are the economic consequences of taking this one option? how will it impact our family? and our autonomy? our friendships? is it aligned with our purpose in life? with what we value about the PhD? Make a list of all these important aspects, paying special attention to put there questions that represent our personal values and the main thing we value about doing a PhD (as per last week\u0026rsquo;s post). Now, let\u0026rsquo;s rate each option from 1\u0026ndash;10 on each of these different aspects or kinds of consequences. Only after we have done this review dimension by dimension, we can allow ourselves to make the intuitive, but informed, decision. We could also just take the option with the highest average score, but that is not mandatory, since some dimensions could weigh more than others in our hearts and minds. Prototype the most likely options or decisions. One of the biggest problems with decision-making, especially in decisions that will affect our lives deeply, is that we humans are notoriously bad at predicting what will make us happy (or unhappy), and how we will feel once we are in a certain situation (like \u0026ldquo;researching topic X in lab Y\u0026rdquo;)3. By now, after doing all of the above, we will probably have 1-3 options that are clearer favorites. We could just take the decision right now by flipping a coin but, if we still have the time (remember the motto, \u0026ldquo;slow down\u0026rdquo;!), we could also try a \u0026ldquo;prototype\u0026rdquo;, a smaller version of our favorite options4: the idea is to try to live for a short time, or at least vividly imagine, how our lives would be under that option. How do we prototype a new direction in life? Here are two ideas, but others are also possible:  Talk with people that already do what you are considering. Chances are, there is somebody out there that is already doing a PhD in that lab, or working with the methods or topic you are considering. The idea here is to get in touch with them and see if they can spare a short while for a conversation, and have them describe how it is to live under that option/alternative: what they spend their time really doing, what are the main advantages, or pain points. We need to picture in our minds how it is to live that way. Do not emphasize so much whether they are happy or not (which is a judgement they\u0026rsquo;ll do according to their values, not ours), but try to understand why. It is important to note that this is not a job interview, so don\u0026rsquo;t expect a job offer from them \u0026ndash; just some friendly conversation about how it is to live/work/research in that situation we are considering. Live a smaller-scale version of the option: if we are considering a particular lab to do our PhD, we can propose to do a summer internship in that same lab; if we are considering a two-year postdoc, we can do a one-month research stay to start collaborating with them; we can do a small pilot study in the direction or methodology that we are considering for the big change in thesis direction\u0026hellip; It may turn out that we actually like the new topic that we feared, or that it is hell to work in that very prestigious and cutting-edge lab we were aiming for.   Visualization: Give advice to your best friend. Now, we really have all the elements we need for the decision: options, and in-depth analysis, even actual experience with some them. Yet, even with all that in our hands, we may feel \u0026ldquo;analysis paralysis\u0026rdquo;, or we may just be overwhelmed by the importance of the decision, unable to choose. In these situations the following visualization exercise may help put ourselves in the right frame of mind and unblock. Take some minutes alone in a quiet place, close your eyes and imagine that you are sitting with your best friend; they come to you in distress, saying that they have to make an important decision, and that they have all this information (the one we have gathered till now), but still they cannot decide; they ask for your advice: what to do? Do not rush an answer. The idea is to, really, visualize our friend and reason (in writing, if that helps you) what would be our advice to them and why. If you still resist the decision: Set your fears. Now we have a decision (whatever we would advice our best friend). We know this probably is the right option for us. Still, sometimes we look at this option we know is right, and still we cannot bring ourselves to do it. It is too scary, or it sounds just too unusual. It happened to me when I decided to leave a well-paid, stable job in industry to start an academic PhD with no funding. Once I decided it was what I wanted, it still took me a while (and a lot of willpower) to start acting upon that decision. When we are sure that one option is the right one for us, but still fear taking that path, we can take millenia-old advice from Stoic philosophers, and do what they called a premeditatio malorum (also called \u0026ldquo;negative visualization\u0026rdquo;): basically, you take some time to really reflect upon the question \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s the worst that could happen (if you do the thing you are afraid of doing)?\u0026rdquo;. And I mean really thinking it through and writing down things like: what bad consequences can come from doing it (and how likely they are), how to avoid these bad consequences, or recover from them if they happen, what bad consequences (especially, in the long-term) can come from not doing what we fear doing, or what long-term benefits can come from doing what we fear, even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out 100%. A modern version of this exercise is described in detail in this TED talk and blog post by author Tim Ferriss.  In my experience, from all of the above will emerge a great option to try out, a great path to walk down. It may be scary. It may be uncertain. The final piece of advice is this: Just do it, and move on. Don\u0026rsquo;t look back to the other options or agonize about \u0026ldquo;what ifs\u0026rdquo;. Just. Do. It. If the path we have to walk is still too big, too complex or too scary, we can break it down into a checklist of smaller steps5,6 (so that we can see ourselves making progress towards it), and start with the first thing in the checklist.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t wait. Start today.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. The graph below summarizes these steps and exercises:\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rDiagram of the decision process\n\r\r\rEpilogue: What if we were wrong, after all? What if we start walking that path we carefully chose and, after some weeks, or months (or years!) we find out that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work quite as we expected, or that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy us as much as we thought? Well, guess what: we can take another decision then. After we have tried that path for a time, maybe we will understand ourselves better, or know better the people and the situation around us, or how those places, fields or communities work. We will then be wiser.\nIf we took the decision with the best knowledge we got from the steps above, then there is no space for regrets. No decision is taken in vain.\nNo path is walked in vain.\nWe will have learned something. As PhD students (and as humans), we are learning throughout our whole life.\nNext time, we will take even better decisions.\nAre you facing a hard dilemma in your PhD right now?

In this two-part post series, I will not give the answer to those hard questions, but rather provide a decision process that can help us find the option that is right for us, in our particular circumstances.\n Since I started this blog, PhD students have contacted me for advice regarding difficult decisions or situations they are facing in their doctorate. As I have found myself giving quite similar advice to multiple people, the engineer in me (always trying to automate tasks) thought of putting that advice into writing, so that we can reuse it the next time we want to help a friend or a colleague facing a thorny decision (or we face such decisions ourselves).\nThe request often goes like this:\n I\u0026rsquo;m a (X)th-year PhD student in (insert field about which I have no clue), at the (insert country/university I have never been to).\nI am currently blocked in my PhD because of (insert problem, often external to the PhD student: the supervisor is unresponsive, or wants to radically change the direction of the PhD for reasons the student does not understand, or funding is unavailable, or has run out, \u0026hellip; ).\nI am considering (insert something that is difficult to face, like quitting the PhD, asking for a change in supervisor, continuing the PhD without funding, or taking an unrelated job to survive economically). What should I do?\n The first response that comes to mind is:\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what the best solution is for you. Really. I don\u0026rsquo;t know you as a person, what is valuable and important for you, your skills and attitudes, your foibles. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the context you\u0026rsquo;re in. And those things often make all the difference between a decision that makes us happy and fulfilled, and another that makes us miserable. The question \u0026ldquo;what should I do?\u0026rdquo; seems to imply that the situation is a problem with a single solution, applicable to everyone, like a math problem. Yet, the more I think about these problems and talk to different people, the less I think that is the case: situations are infinitely varied, and people have very different wants and needs to keep them reasonably happy.\nSo, probably you can stop reading now, right? Wait, wait\u0026hellip; I know it is very hard to reach out to a stranger for help, and I want to encourage help-seeking (people often never get help just because they don\u0026rsquo;t dare to ask enough). What I can give is the next best thing I know: advice on how I\u0026rsquo;d go about making that decision, now that I am a bit older and (one would hope) a bit wiser than I used to be. A process to decide what the best solution might be for you particularly, in your own circumstances. Below is the advice (or meta-advice) I\u0026rsquo;d give my past, PhD student self.\nA decision process for important doctorate decisions Maybe \u0026ldquo;decision process\u0026rdquo; is too ambitious a word. Rather, I tend to give a bucket list of ideas, questions and strategies that have helped me before (and still help me to this day) in thinking through and facing difficult, important decisions with a clear(er) mind. At its heart, this process has only two phases:\n Expand our understanding of the situation and the options Analyze the options and take a decision  Easy, right? Well, not quite\u0026hellip; there are many ways to do both of those things. In fact, my first piece of (meta-advice) is this: use multiple methods and triangulate. Triangulation is an interesting strategy, used in certain research areas, by which one uses multiple methods, perspectives or data sources to investigate the same question, which can increase the validity of our findings1. In this case, we are facing an important decision, and we haven\u0026rsquo;t found an easy answer to the dilemma so far \u0026ndash; hence, it is probably a good idea to look and think more broadly and deeply about it.\nWhat follows is a long, but worthwhile, exercise \u0026ndash; use it wisely (e.g., don\u0026rsquo;t use it for deciding what clothes to wear every morning)!\nExpanding our understanding of the situation The first phase in the decision process is about expanding our understanding about the decision, which includes understanding ourselves (!), other people involved, the situation, and the different options available. We often try to take quick decisions based on very rudimentary knowledge, intuition, or simple heuristics, and that can backfire in so many ways2. For instance, I may think I don\u0026rsquo;t want to go towards a new research direction, but\u0026hellip; how do I know that I won\u0026rsquo;t like it? have I done it before? would that direction still give me skills I want to attain during my PhD, even if the topic is not exactly what I expected to do? The following points can help improve our understanding of all this, in more structured way:\n Understand ourselves. This may seem like an obvious thing (of course we know who we are and what we want!), but we seldom spend time explicitly reflecting about what we think is important in life, or what is our purpose. Yet, such reflections can bring a lot of clarity when taking an important life decision. There are several different ways to get at these values and purpose (I suggest doing all of them, as they bring complementary views \u0026ndash; again, triangulate!):  One of the biggest discoveries I\u0026rsquo;ve made in recent years, which has changed how I see the human world and how I read situations (and, especially, conflicts between people), is the research on cross-cultural values, such as Schwartz\u0026rsquo;s basic values theory3. Such values are things that people think are desirable and important to different degrees, such as getting pleasure or fulfilling customs and traditions. And every one of us has a different combination and hierarchy of such values. This is the main reason I resist advising people to go down a particular path: I would choose that path from the point of view of my values, and most probably the option that would keep me happy (e.g., because it aligns with my value of self-direction) would make you unhappy (because you value more something else, like helping people close to you). This difference is all the more probable if you come from a different country/culture than me. To find out which of these values tend to influence us the most, we can do the Portrait Values Questionnaire (look at the files attached in that page). Living a life that is according to one\u0026rsquo;s values is one of the central tenets of many philosophies, and of modern psychotherapy approaches like ACT (which we already mentioned when introducing typical mental health issues in the doctorate). There are many exercises and questionnaires that we can do to bring out our main purpose and values, and how aligned our life is with them. For instance, one can imagine oneself attending one\u0026rsquo;s own funeral, and write down what we would like people to say about our life and what it stood for4. We can also look at this alignment between what we do and what we value from the perspective of different areas in our life (e.g., our family, our work, or our physical self-care). One way to do this is by rating the relative importance of the different areas, and how much we have been honoring each area lately, which is what the research-backed Valued Living Questionnaire5 does. There are many other ways we can reflect about our values and purpose. Those that force us to pause, take some time and write down stuff in a structured way tend to provide more clarity (and a tangible outcome). For example, I personally like the exercises to build a \u0026ldquo;personal mission statement\u0026rdquo; described in this post (from a blog about personal finance, of all places).   Understand what we want out of the PhD. All that talk about values and purpose may seem quite abstract and unrelated to the concrete dilemma at hand\u0026hellip; but it is not. Once we have those values, purpose and mission clearly in front of us, we can look at how doing a PhD fits into that picture: is it just a stepping stone to a better job because we want more money? is it about doing \u0026ldquo;my own thing\u0026rdquo;? is it about learning new skills? interacting with smart people? We can make a list of aspects in which the PhD is aligned with what we value, and aspects in which the PhD is working against what we value. This will also be very useful later on, when we consider different alternatives if we need to change our current PhD situation or direction. Understand the people involved and their motives, beyond the obvious. This is critical if the hard decision we\u0026rsquo;re struggling with is some kind of inter-personal conflict. If the supervisor is unresponsive or proposes a change of direction, why is it? I have found it is seldom because of pure malice: sometimes it is just selfish convenience, sometimes it is a decision pushed on them from above, or better funding prospects, or something else. Talk with them as openly and clearly as possible, and talk also with other people in the lab/department that may have more information (maybe there are other actors in the play that we know nothing about!). Try to understand the other party\u0026rsquo;s point of view, what they value. This improved understanding will help us devise new creative options that may satisfy both our and the other party\u0026rsquo;s needs, if there needs to be a negotiation as part of solving the situation (see the notion of \u0026ldquo;principled negotiation\u0026rdquo; developed at Harvard6). Create more options. We tend to think about hard, complex situations in terms of binary choices (do I leave the PhD or continue enduring my current blockage?) but\u0026hellip; are they really binary? Contrary to what happens in the Matrix, Neo could have done many other things aside from the blue-red pill dilemma (like taking none of the pills, or both). We often ignore the fact that the space of options is virtually limitless (one could change supervisors, change to doing research part-time, change topic/direction, change to another lab, try a different research approach\u0026hellip;). There are many techniques and exercises one can use (either by oneself or with the help of a group) to generate more options for our dilemma, beyond the classic \u0026ldquo;brainstorm\u0026rdquo; (I personally find \u0026ldquo;brainwriting\u0026rdquo; more useful in a group setting). One could try any of the exercises in De Bono\u0026rsquo;s classic book on creativity7, or my personal favorite when I want some ideas real quick: the \u0026ldquo;Crazy 8s\u0026rdquo;. Keep in mind that, at this point, crazy, wild ideas are welcome: leaving everything and opening a bar in Bahamas, trying that new research method that nobody in our field has ever tried, starting our own company selling the PhD contribution, or whatever. Later on we will discard or make more viable versions of these crazy ideas \u0026ndash; the point now is mainly to understand that we are not just stuck between a rock and a hard place. Seek help or resources at our institution. I\u0026rsquo;m amazed at how often this one is overlooked. Universities are increasingly offering their students and staff with resources to help in difficult situations, be it giving advice directly, pointing us towards relevant information about funding, or institutional rules about situations like ours. There are research offices, counseling and mental health units, student unions\u0026hellip; and very often these resources are under-used because of poor publicity. Ask around, look into the institution\u0026rsquo;s website: we may end up surprised about what\u0026rsquo;s available to help us. Talk with multiple people about the problem/situation. Preferably, people whose opinions and wisdom we respect: mentors, good friends, family\u0026hellip; Of course, it is good to include any academics and colleagues in our field or university (because they may understand well some aspects of the situation), but also people outside academia: our dear auntie whose advice we always found useful, or anyone who may know us well and have our best interests at heart. Yet, don\u0026rsquo;t ask for (or expect) ready-made solutions to the problem from them (although some may think they are handing us just that). And don\u0026rsquo;t take these consultations as some kind of \u0026ldquo;majority voting\u0026rdquo;, by putting people through closed questions like \u0026ldquo;should I do A or B?\u0026rdquo;. Rather, we want to keep the conversation and the questions open-ended (\u0026ldquo;what would you do?\u0026rdquo; or, better, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what to do\u0026rdquo;): we are looking for novel perspectives on the situation, or new ways to think about the problem. And of course, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to follow the path that any of them shows us (we can explicitly say that we\u0026rsquo;re talking with many people about this) because, guess what: they are giving us ideas from the point of view of what they value (see point #1 above), which most probably is not the same combination of things that we value. The decision is still ours, we will be the ones to live with the consequences of it. Yet, it is always useful to be reminded of advantages, disadvantages or alternative options to our dilemma.  Quite recently I was facing a difficult career decision myself, and I had the feeling I had just a couple of pretty-bad options. After doing all of the exercises above, I had much more clarity about what was important, and more than a handful alternatives, options, new perspectives and pieces of a potential solution. Some were wild, some were obvious. But at least, I was not stuck without alternatives that did not appeal to me.\nNow, we just have to make a choice.\nSadly, this post has already become quite long, so I will finish telling you about my decision-making process next week. Until then, I hope you can start putting these strategies into practice.\nMay you never run out of creative options to your dilemmas.\nAre you facing such hard decisions or dilemmas in your doctorate (or as a postdoctoral researcher)?

Yet, what does the research say about taking holidays, is it really good for you as a doctoral student? Are there better or worse ways of taking a vacation? As preparation for the blog’s own summer hiatus, this post goes over the benefits, pitfalls, and optimal dynamics of taking a longer break.\nDuring my time as a PhD student, and later working in academic research in different labs and different countries, I have found a wide variety of conceptions of what holidays should be during the PhD… and a surprising uniformity in the guilt and unease that PhD students themselves feel when faced with the perspective of closing the laptop for a couple of weeks and heading out of the campus. Indeed, several recent university reports mention that doctoral students tend to not use all their allotted holidays, and encourage them to enjoy the full quantity of them.\nIn many labs, a yearly break from the PhD is recommended (or enforced) from above, but from the student’s perspective, it can mean anything from “I still work on my thesis, I just don’t tell anyone” to “I’ll just take it a bit easier, but work nevertheless”, to “full disconnection! the laptop stays in the lab”. To add to this confusion, each university has its own rules and regulations as to what the status of a PhD student is (worker? student? both?) and what it means in terms of yearly holidays (the bottom line being, take whatever holidays you can get!).\nSo, as a doctoral student, you probably are still wondering: Should I take a break at all? Shouldn’t I take advantage of the drop in emails and meetings to push forward and really advance in my dissertation? What is the “right way” of doing this holiday thing? Let’s take a look, not only at what this humble researcher (and many others) also at what the “science of holidays” says (yes, there is such a thing – just GScholar up “leisure research”).\nShould you take holidays? What the science says For doctoral students. I have not found any empirical study specifically looking into the effect of holidays on the wellbeing (or progress) of doctoral students. There are, however, plenty of advice-type papers (i.e., not empirical) written by peers and more senior advisors, which clearly recommend doctoral students to take holidays1,2.\nTo find empirical research on the benefits of a holiday, we have to go into more general organizational psychology, studying workers in different sectors. This is a line of research which is relatively new, yet it has found quite a few interesting things already:\nEffects on physical health. Many people think of holidays as “rest for the mind”, but some of the correlates of holidays are with physical health. Some studies (and meta-analyses of existing research3) show that a variety of health and wellbeing indicators (sleep quality, fatigue, tension, energy levels) improve during and shortly after 7-to-11-day holidays, although the effect sizes are not very large. Furthermore, those improved health and wellbeing levels revert to the pre-holiday baselines quite fast4. Similar studies for longer vacations (more than two weeks) and shorter ones (4-5 days) found similar results, with the increases in health and wellbeing peaking around the eighth day of holidays5,6. Yet, longer-term (five-year) studies found that taking holidays is correlated with lower all-cause mortality (at least, among middle-aged men at high risk of coronary heart disease7). So, if you want to live longer and healthier, probably holidays are a good idea.\nEffects on the mind. Most of you may be thinking of this when you think about taking a vacation… and most of what is said above about physical health also applies to mental health: psychological qualities like mood, life satisfaction, or emotional exhaustion, also improve somewhat during (and shortly after) holidays, but then quickly revert to the baseline3. There is even a study on whether the holidays increase workers’ creativity (i.e., their ability to come up with new, original ideas): while there was a small but significant increase in cognitive flexibility (the ability to break ordinary patterns of thought and conventional solutions, i.e., finding a wider range of ideas), the originality of ideas themselves after the holidays remained largely the same8.\nDoing holidays… the right way Now that we know that taking holidays is good (even if its effects are not long-lasting)… What is a good way to take them to reap the most benefits? Leisure research and doctoral advice literature also have a few things to say about that.\nWhat to do before the holidays. Reaping the full benefit of a holiday starts, strangely, before the holidays themselves. I don’t know about you but, for me, the week before holidays tends to be a stressful nightmare of trying to finish all the tasks and fulfilling all deadlines (some of them falling into the holiday period, thus compressing into less time what you originally had planned to do). And that’s not even counting any tasks needed for the preparation of the holidays themselves (planning, booking, packing, cleaning…). It turns out the decrease in wellbeing from two to one week before vacation, is a well-known phenomenon, called “pre-holiday stress”9, and it is correlated with the workload (and “homeload”) on the weeks leading to the holiday. Thus, if you can, try to plan the week before the holidays as a “light load” week at work… because home stuff and unexpected work tasks will pop up, and that added stress could cancel out the net benefit of the holidays if we are not careful.\nIndeed, from a physiological perspective, it seems that the strong contrast between the high pre-holiday levels of stress hormones and their almost complete absence in the holidays might be partly responsible for the classic sickness that some people often experience on the first days of holidays (which also has a name, “leisure sickness”). Typical symptoms of this leisure sickness are wide-ranging, from headaches, migraines or fatigue, to colds and other viral infections10. There are even certain reports that perfectionists with high workloads, strong commitment, and feelings of responsibility to their work (a quite common profile among PhD students) are especially at risk of this kind of sickness11. How to avoid this leisure sickness? the same authors suggest doing physical exercise on the last evening of work (to release the stress hormones and energy that may have been building up in that last week of work), adapting your sleep patterns progressively, and avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption during these transitions10.\nWhat to do during the holidays. Several studies have tried to see what holiday activities seem to relate with most gains in wellbeing and longer-lasting effects12. Studies about short vacations (4-5 days)5 highlight that activities involving relaxation, psychological detachment from work (more on that below), and having conversations with a partner, seem most correlated with health and wellbeing gains (aside from other obvious correlates like the pleasure derived from activities, or having less negative incidents). Studying the benefits of longer vacations (i.e., more than 2 weeks)6 found that the overall duration of the holidays (e.g., going out for two vs. three weeks) does not seem to change much the benefits, and neither do most of the activities we do in them. Exceptions to this include more passive activities, relaxation, sleep, or those that involve savoring an experience. Also, having a sense of control over one’s time seems to be related to better outcomes from the vacation. So, next time you are faced with the choice between taking a slow vacation day relaxing and having a good meal or doing a whirlwind day tour to visit five different tourist attractions… what’s it gonna be?\nAnother whole related issue is what to abstain from doing during holidays – especially, whether one should do (or think) anything work-related. “Psychological detachment from work” involves not doing nor thinking about work during off-job time, and has nothing to do with one’s engagement during work time. Empirical studies have shown that this kind of “switching off” from work during leisure has several critical benefits (especially in shorter vacations13), including improved long-term wellbeing and life satisfaction (e.g., lower emotional exhaustion and burnout), being better able to handle stressful situations, and generally better task performance and proactive behavior at work14. Again, research shows that certain kinds of people, who react strongly to negative events or have high levels of job involvement (again, a red flag for many PhD students), may find it difficult to detach in this way, tending to ruminate or worry about job situations even during leisure. High workloads and time pressure at work are also known to make it hard to detach. How can we help ourselves detach better from work? Researchers recommend doing meaningful activities (e.g., volunteer work), engaging in activities or settings that fascinate us (i.e., that effortlessly capture our attention, like a beautiful natural environment) and, in general, having clear physical and mental boundaries between work and non-work (something that has become increasingly difficult in these times of coronavirus)14. Recent studies also point to mobile technologies making it hard to detach from work15, unless one is able to create boundaries around their use16.\nOther practical tips that can be found in empirical and advice papers include:\n Take the freakin’ holidays! It can help you think about your dissertation ideas in a different way2. Plan your holidays in your calendar well in advance, and do not plan any major research, deadlines or tasks during those weeks (nor, preferably, the week before or after the holidays, to avoid the aforementioned pre-holiday stress and leisure sickness). Let supervisors and colleagues know you are going on holiday, and activate your out-of-office automated response emails1. Pro tip: add a day or two after you come back to the automated response email, to give you some time “under the radar” to gather yourself and plan/prioritize the tasks that have been accumulating in your absence. Try not to check your email during the holidays (it helps if the auto-response email already says clearly that you will not check your email)1. If you really want to do something work-related, do it whenever you feel like it, and on your own terms – not as a duty or obligation (remember, having a sense of control over your time is critical during holidays)6. Despite all of the above about detaching from work, ideas about your research or dissertation may pop up. That’s OK. Indeed, carry with you a notebook or recorder (or phone) so that you can record them1, which has the double advantage of letting the idea go off from your head quicker, and ensuring you will not forget this flash of insight once you get back to work after holidays. Use the peak-end rule (the fact that we remember experiences mostly based on what is the most emotionally intense part of them, and whatever happens in their final part17) to your advantage when planning your holiday activities. Try to engage all your senses in what you do during the holidays, to mindfully savor them, and end the vacation on a high note (e.g., clean and pack beforehand, and do a really nice experience on the last day of holidays). Start slowly after the holiday trip ends: have a weekend at home to unpack and relax from the stresses of traveling18, and try to have a “slow week” after coming back to work, which may help preserve the beneficial effects of vacations for a longer time19. Keep alive the “afterglow” of the holidays, by reinforcing the good memories of your vacation reviewing photos or videos, reconnecting with the new friends you’ve made, or cooking up the latest exotic recipe you learned during your trip abroad. In general, if you have that flexibility, do more, shorter vacations (since their benefits tend to be short-lived). It seems that 7-11 days seem to be the optimal length6, so if you have 30 days you can spend at any time, better do three 10-day holidays over the year, rather than a single one-month period (especially, if that period is the peak-high season when every holiday destination is crowded). That said, if you have difficulties detaching from work (see the personality profiles mentioned above), you can make your vacations a bit longer than that, to account for the increased time it will take you to really disconnect from work. Many of the insights from leisure research mentioned above also apply in the day-to-day breaks we have during the working periods – every workday evening and every weekend. Thus, look at the advice above (detach from work, savor and relax, exercise to release stress after work, etc.), and make every day a successful “mini-holiday”.  Now that we’ve gone over all of this, I have a little confession to make: I have done this post for entirely selfish reasons. I wanted to know what did the research say about the best way to take a holiday… so that I can apply it to the summer break I’m starting right now. As it turns out, I already failed at some of the rules and recommendations above (my last week of work was way too busy, and I’m trying to fight off some mild leisure sickness with a lot of sleep). But, like everything in research and academia, this is a practice, and even the senior researchers fail and fall off the wagon. It is progress, not perfection, that should be our goal. We need to keep on trying – because this holiday thing definitely has benefits!\nYou can expect the blog to come back at the beginning of September.

However, there are many things about research that are random, chaotic, and require loads of creativity (writing papers being only one example among many). Thus, it sometimes makes sense to think about research as an art… and sometimes we can reuse tricks and advice from the arts, to make better science. In this brief post, I give you a couple of those, from a well-known artist and writer, in the form of two Monday Mantras.\nAfter the initial, surprisingly smooth period of COVID-related lockdown, the lack of an exclusive workspace (i.e., one that is not at the same time kitchen, or bedroom, or living-room-sofa), the sheer amount of online meetings and hours staring at screens, the lack of a “normal” social life… were beginning to weigh on me. The end of the teaching semester, with its evaluations and other administrative stuff, were not helping either. From my recent conversations with PhD students, this seemed like a common ailment. This is maybe the busiest part of the year, and doing research in these hectic times can certainly seem like a drag (or just impossible). Yet, the other day I found something that lifted me up almost instantly – and it came from the strangest of places.\nFrom an artist.\nI came across this commencement speech given in 2012 at the University of the Arts, by writer Neil Gaiman1. I have long appreciated Neil’s writing (read Good Omens, if you like good, witty fantasy fiction), but I was surprised by how inspiring, funny and disarmingly honest he could be in person. And how relevant to research his advice for artists is.\nThe 20-minute speech is really worth the listen, if you have the time. Just substitute the word “art” with “research”, throughout his speech. If you don’t have the time to do that, just read on for my two main takeaways as a researcher…\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe best research advice... from an artist\n\r\r\r“Make good art research” This short mantra is the title of the speech. For several minutes, Gaiman encourages the audience (made up of aspiring artists) to just do what they went there to do: art (in their case), or research (in yours). Really, just do that. Make good research. Find out answers to questions humanity does not know the answer to yet. That’s what we signed up for, isn’t it?2 Then, just go do good research (or, the best research that you are able do), whatever that looks like in your field. Be a craftsman (or craftswoman) of research. Get lost in it, absorbed in the details of doing it well. As it happens to artists, many of the things we do as researchers are amenable to this experience of “flow”3, of getting lost in them: reading papers to discover the answers to questions we have, finding patterns in data, putting our ideas into writing…\nAs the speech proceeds, much of the advice Gaiman gives artists can also be translated easily to us researchers:\n Don’t do it for the money: ignore the economic side of things (the budgets, the project proposals, the salaries) as much as you can. Don’t just investigate a topic because “that’s where the money is”. Focus on developing your (research) skills, first by copying the rules and methods others use in your field. And, once you master those, find new ones, develop your own new methods and knowledge. The value of learning to write well, as a tool to clarify your own thinking. Make mistakes (as Gaiman puts it, “make amazing mistakes”). Not mistakes out of laziness or sloppiness, but rather those that come from you trying things you were not sure you could pull off, or things you were not sure were possible at all. Grow a thick skin. Even if you try to make the best out of each paper, not all of them will be accepted, some of them may never be published. And that’s OK. The published paper is not per se the ultimate good – the knowledge they contain is the goal. Maybe that knowledge is not needed or understood right now. Or maybe it was already known, but you didn’t know it. The skills and understanding you gained by writing the paper are themselves very important as well. The problems of success. Once you start “succeeding” at research, once you are able to finish some studies and publish them, the problems do not end. You will have to deal with impostor syndrome, you will have to learn to say no, you will have to avoid becoming a “professional emailer, hobbyist writer researcher”, as Gaiman puts it. The awareness that, even if your goal is to do work that is good, delivered on time, and at the same time get along with the people you work with… very often getting two out of those three is enough to get you a job. If you are not sure about how to do good research, pretend you are a good researcher… and then behave like one (this one sounds silly, but I find it profoundly insightful).  … and the final, best piece of advice that he himself received from an even more successful artist (the writer Stephen King). The advice that Gaiman himself failed to follow for years and years, and which is worth its own separate mantra:\n\r\r\rThe best piece of advice that Gaiman regretted he didn\u0026#39;t follow\n\r\r\r“Enjoy the ride” Many people are aware that the PhD can be an “emotional rollercoaster” (best represented by this PhD comic). And it is also well known that we tend to focus on the negative: negative emotions like anxiety or stress; problems, setbacks we face… and there is plenty of talking about those dangers in this blog. Yet, there are also plenty of things to be enjoyed in a PhD: the focus on a single topic, the talking and collaborating with smart people from around the world, the sheer joy of learning new stuff (almost every day!), being able to contribute to something larger than oneself (like human knowledge), the belonging to a group (be it your own local research group or an international community)…\nSo, rather than being always worried about the next deadline, the next email, the next paper… why not recognize that this is actually really fun!? A positive frame of mind will boost your creativity, you energy, and your productivity4. These good times will never come back, trust me.\nSo. Enjoy. Them.\nI hope these two pieces of advice help you, as they are helping me long after the PhD finished.\nDo you have other research advice, mottos or mantras you find useful?

As novice researchers, we may operate under conjectures or assumptions about how scientific authorship works, which may not necessarily be true. In this post, I go over several factors that often weigh in into that decision, and I provide a couple of tips and resources about how I would go about taking that decision, ideally.\nThese days, more of us seem to be writing our scientific papers (be it due to the ending of the academic course, or to COVID-related restrictions on our other activities). Whatever the reason, I’ve also found myself advising PhD students about the issue of setting the authors for their papers and their order – something that looks obvious to the initiated, but rather baffling to novice PhD students and the general public (how can it be that there are scientific papers signed by 5000+ people??1). A common way out of this recurring dilemma is to use simplistic, half-baked assumptions, often born from fear of displeasing others: “the PI/supervisor should be author in all my papers (even those they have not read)”, “anyone who I’ve ever discussed my ideas with should be an author”, or the other extreme, “only I am the author”; or the classic “authors should be in alphabetical order”, etc.\nWhich one of those is true? Is any of those true?\nAs with many things in research, the short answer is: it depends. I’ve seen people go about this in many different ways, which I’ve categorized below for your convenience. Some people say authorship…\n … is local (i.e., every lab or group of researchers creates their own rules). To find this out, we can ask around (to our supervisors and our labmates) how things are done where we are. And I mean to really do it explicitly (i.e., don’t just read between lines from side remarks). Don’t be afraid of looking ignorant. In some labs, they even have written contracts you sign about how authorship should be set. But even in those cases, ask around: sometimes the actual local practice does not match what the written (local) rules say. Find out those local practices… but don’t stop there. There are other things to consider. Read on till the end! … is social (i.e., every scientific community has its own rules). This is where the 5000-author paper comes from: in some fields like astrophysics, genomics or particle physics, it is not uncommon to have such hyperauthorship2, since the discoveries take a huge collaborative effort involving dozens of teams across the globe. And there are fields that are the opposite of that, where the PhD student is expected to be the only author of publications. Again, the solution is to ask around, not only to our supervisors and teammates, but also outside, in conferences, doctoral consortia3 or summer schools. Ask respected researchers in your field, people you admire… they probably have seen many labs and workplaces in your area. This is especially important if local practices (from #1 above) look fishy or unfair: although we may have limited power to change things around us, we can at least raise the issue of this divergence between local and field-accepted authorship practices (in a tone of curiosity, not judgement – why do we do things like this over here?). We may be doing a great service to our local research environment. … is objective. More and more fields (including top journals and conferences) are slowly veering to the idea that all this patchwork of local practices is not really fair or systematic (and research is all about being systematic!), and advocate for more unified and clear-cut criteria for authorship. One of the most widely cited (and clearest) criteria in this regard was put out by the “Vancouver group”, being thus known as the “Vancouver recommendations”4. While these recommendations were put out by a committee of medical journal editors, they have since been adopted by many, many other fields and national-level ethical committees. The recommendations state that, to be an author, you must meet all of the following criteria (even if minimally):  Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND Final approval of the version to be published; AND Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.   … is personal. Although the four criteria in #3 seem quite clear, there are still situations where checking these criteria is not necessarily easy. For instance, if we asked for feedback and received only very few comments, is it because co-authors have not read the paper (criteria #3.2 above), or did they do it and find no fault in it? Besides, the criteria above don’t help us much in setting the author order. While there is no ideal solution to all these issues, the best approach I’ve seen so far (stolen from the field of collaborative learning5) is to ask potential co-authors for a self-evaluation of their contribution: basically, ask each co-author whether they deserve authorship and how much they think they have contributed. Additionally, we could also ask them to rate each other’s contributions (if the context provides enough visibility about what everybody does). While this seems to open the door for all sorts of dishonesty, in my experience researchers tend to be a fairly honest bunch (you know, there are other professions where dishonesty is more handsomely paid 😉). … is specified. Another increasing trend in many journals and scientific publications is to ask specifically for the contributions of each of the authors, in a more qualitative manner (sometimes called “contribution disclosures”)6, as in: “X did the data analysis and revised the manuscript for intellectual content”; or “Y performed the data gathering”7. In some journals like Science, they even ask what percentage of each kind of contribution each actor did! Hence, we should be prepared to answer such questions when submitting our paper to a journal.  Which one of the five methods above is the right one? Probably all of them, to some extent. My main advice would be to use multiple methods, and triangulate (as they say in qualitative and mixed-methods research8). To help you do that, I have created a simple questionnaire that synthesizes principles #3-5 above (which I\u0026rsquo;ve added to the \u0026ldquo;PhD toolbox\u0026rdquo;). You can create your own form by copying those questions, or modifying them to your liking, for use in your own paper writing processes.\nJust before we take off, I’d like to add three additional things to take into account, sort of “meta-principles” to help us apply the five principles above. Authorship is also…\n … about time. Talk about these issues from the very beginning of the co-writing process (remember that forming the co-author team is one of the first steps of the paper writing process I recommend). Discuss with your co-authors what the conditions for authorship will be, and the criteria for their ordering. That way, no one will feel betrayed down the road. And, of course, do not use otherwise fair criteria like the Vancouver recommendations as a weapon to exclude people from authorship unilaterally: if someone contributed to the research substantially (#3.1), we should give them also the opportunity to contribute to the text (#3.2 and #3.3) and take responsibility (#3.4). If they don’t take those opportunities, that’s their choice – no hard feelings. … evolving (and we can help). As mentioned in the principles above, the practices and customs of journals, scientific communities and individual labs, all are evolving, as we learn better ways to handle authorship and make the whole publishing process (hopefully) fairer. It seems that most places are slowly going towards a more objective approach (#3)… and we can be agents of change in our local setting/lab as well, even if we are just novice researchers. We can gently raise the issue, ask questions about the reasons for local authorship habits, and talk about these criteria and good practices that we have read about. Very often, being gentle and curious will work better than being pushy and judgmental. But YMMV. … our (i.e., the first author’s) choice. In the end, after all this discussion and criteria, it is the first author who normally has the last word. What seems fair to you? Of course, our present choices (and how fair they are) condition whether people will want to collaborate with us in the future: if we completely disregard or rip people off, we will run out of collaborators very fast (and research is more and more a team sport, remember!); if we hand out authorships too liberally, we (and them!) may run into problems down the road as more and more places move to the objective criteria/paradigm (e.g., what will happen if some error is detected and we have to retract our paper?).  Here is a graphic summarizing the main ideas of the post. I hope those were useful.

But, how can we know if we have one of these mental health problems, right here, right now? In this post, co-authored with colleague, friend and therapist Paula Odriozola-González, we go over a few basic concepts of psychopathology, and propose criteria and simple practices to help separate internal experiences that we all go through at one time or another, from the more serious stuff.\nTake a look at this list of thoughts and ideas:\n I’m never going to finish Why does it seem that everyone progresses faster than I do? I’m always tired I’m not in the mood for anything Don’t know what I’m doing with my life In the end, why am I doing this? I feel like my life does not go forward Sometimes I’m short of breath I have trouble sleeping I don’t know what to do next I’m not capable enough to do this I’m in over my head with this PhD/research thing I’m blocked  Since you started the PhD, have you ever had any of these thoughts? Count how many different ones you’ve experienced so far.\nIf you are like any of the PhD students that came to our workshops on progress in the PhD, you’ve experienced at least one of those. Indeed, more than half of our students had experienced 3 or more. I can certainly tell you that many of those thoughts passed through my own mind (some quite persistently) during my own PhD. Especially in the tough times, when things didn’t go the way I wanted. And I didn’t even have a difficult PhD process.\nOn top of those thoughts, there are other worrisome symptoms that we might experience, be them physiological (e.g., elevated heart rate in the absence of exercise, trembling), emotional (e.g., a feeling of sadness) or behavioral (e.g., avoiding work related to our thesis)1. Yet, negative thoughts like the ones above are very commonly found, and hard to separate ourselves from.\nAnd, on top of that, during the current times of coronavirus, an additional set of negative thoughts, feelings and body sensations has been added to our internal experience: having trouble sleeping, feeling a pressure in the chest, thinking “my relative is going to die”, “the economy is never going to recover”, “people are going crazy (or stupid)”, “we are all going to die”…\nDoes that mean that we are all pathologically anxious or depressed? That we are all crazy people?\nThe basic answer to those questions is “probably not”. Such experiences, such thoughts and bodily sensations are just an integral part of what it is to be a human being. Sometimes we get positive experiences like joy or creative ideas… and sometimes we get other experiences, like the ones above, which we label as negative.\nThen, you might say, when should we start considering that we have a problem?\nThe basic answer is simple, yet more subtle: whenever these symptoms start interfering with our normal functioning2. In other words, when these symptoms make us suffer, and we start to consistently change the way we act, the way we live, to avoid having them. In a way, these “negative experiences” become the center of our lives. This is what some psychologists call experiential avoidance, and is one of the common denominators of mental health troubles, from anxiety and depression to chronic pain3.\nI have plenty of examples of this avoidance, from my own PhD: that time I started working more on collaborations with other researchers than in analyzing my own data (to avoid the uncertainty of whether results would be good – or the certainty that they were not good enough); or that other time I spent weeks reading more and more literature (which I knew I could do effectively) rather than drafting the plan for my last year of dissertation (which would kickstart a long period of hard, intense work which scared me)… Luckily, in my case these avoidance strategies did not go on indefinitely: either I shook them off myself, or others helped me do it by pointing them out and encouraging me.\nProbably you have your own go-to avoidance strategies too. We all do. For some of us it can be distractions like binge-watching Netflix, continuously playing computer games, or reading about our “passion topics” not related to the thesis. It can be about numbing out these difficult emotions with alcohol or drugs. It depends on the circumstances and on the person.\nAnd, let’s be clear: there is nothing wrong with any of those avoidance strategies per se, if done sporadically. However, when it becomes a repetitive, almost compulsive thing we consistently do to avoid those negative experiences, it can be a problem. When it interferes with our normal lives and what we consider important in them (e.g., to become doctors, our role as a parent, a son, a friend, a professional… whatever is important for us specifically), we may be heading for trouble.\nThus, if you feel you are able to work, to function and act normally towards your goals, towards the important areas of your life, probably you are fine. Note that I wrote “normally”, not “optimally” or anything like that: sometimes these negative experiences visit us, and sometimes we allow them to be there for a while, or we allow our avoidance strategy to happen. And that’s OK. However, if these negative thoughts or feelings (or avoiding them) seem to be playing too much of an important role in your life, it may be worth investigating. How? Other than going to see a professional therapist, you can try a couple of simple things, following the same schema that we followed in the happiness in the lab series, of first diagnosing (observing how things are currently for us), and then intervening (i.e., trying some new practice or changing what we do):\n Observe/Diagnose: Try to remember the last times when these negative experiences (thoughts, feelings, actions) happened to you. What were you doing? How was the situation, who was there with you? And what did you do as a response? Better yet, you can spend some days carrying pen and paper (or a journal) with you, and noting down these episodes as they happen: what was the situation (what were you doing, where and with whom), what negative or problematic experience arose, and how did you respond. After several days of doing this (or remembering 6-10 of these episodes), try to see if there are trends in these episodes: common feelings or thoughts, common places or people or activities that prompt them. And, especially, what is your response to these problematic experiences: if, after thinking “I’m never going to finish the thesis”, you are able to keep doing what you were doing (even if the thought remains there for some time), then probably you are functioning according to your values and goals (i.e., there is no cause for alarm). If you find yourself constantly interrupting what you do, if those thoughts or feelings (and what you do to avoid them) are becoming an obstacle to doing what you think is important (e.g., complete your thesis), maybe you can try the simple practice in #2 below… Intervene: Keep some pieces of paper and a pen with you at all times. Then, throughout your day, try catching yourself when you are thinking these thoughts or having these feelings (e.g., “I’m never finishing this thesis”). Be simple about it, don’t judge yourself or the thought. Simply notice “ah, I am having this thought of never finishing the thesis”, as if it was something interesting you just discovered (it actually is!). Write the thought on a piece of paper (yes, write “I’m never finishing this thesis” on the paper). Notice how, as you put it on paper and are able to look at it there, in front of you, its power over you is somehow limited. You don’t need to reject it or destroy it (this is not voodoo magic), but you can just fold it and put it in your back pocket, and continue what you were doing. The thought may or may not disappear, but even if it accompanies you, you’ll have shown it (and yourself) that it can be there and you can still function as a human being that goes towards the goals you consider important4.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rGraphical summary of the ideas in the post\n\r\r\rWe hope those tips prove useful to you. This kind of techniques are used by a particular approach to psychological therapy called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which is part of what is called contextual therapies5. The “contextual” bit is important, actually: it means that these concepts and techniques are not blanket recipes that will work always for everyone – rather, the should be understood and applied in our own particular context (e.g., the same behavior of going out for a run can be an important nourishing action for someone, and a problematic avoidance strategy for another person). In the next post, we’ll introduce some more basic concepts and practices related to this approach, which could be useful to deal with these negative experiences during the doctorate; and especially, the notion of acceptance (which already featured in the post on factors that seem protective against depression in the PhD).\nBonus: How are you doing during the COVID-19 pandemic? Just a few more words to check in with all of you and ask how things are going, given the current special circumstances during the COVID-19 emergency. I’ve talked recently with quite a few PhD students, and the variety of experiences is staggering: some have more time to concentrate now, and seem to be advancing faster; for others, the current lockdown has brought all plans and advance on their thesis to a grinding halt. If you, like me, are curious to know how our small community is doing during this crisis, please answer the few short questions below. It should take less than a minute. And you will get to see the survey results once you respond.\nHeader image by fbiwu\n  You can find a more complete list of common symptoms associated with mental health problems in the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales, see Lovibond, P.

An intro to mental health in the doctorate"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"Not a few of the people that read this blog, do so with a very clear outcome in mind: to finish their PhD, to get that damned piece of paper saying that they’re doctors. In this struggle, we (yes, I did that too) often forget that the PhD is more of a process (a learning, a practice) than it is an outcome. In this adaptation of a poem by Wendell Berry, I take a stab at what it took for me to become a researcher. I write this as much for you as for myself – to remind myself that, in a sense, we never cease to be students, we remain always beginners in the new knowledge that we (and others) create with our research.\nIt is with a lot of hesitation that I write this post, in a time when many of us are facing challenges far greater than a PhD. Thousands of people are dying or risking their lives every day, some of them quite close to us. This reminder of mortality does strange things to one’s motivation. My own morale to continue doing research (which has never been rock-solid) falters sometimes. However, the other day I happened to come across a poem by Wendell Berry: How to be a poet – go read it, it almost applies to researchers as-is! Then, someone proposed an exercise: do your own version of the poem, about what it means to be a researcher.\nThis is what came out, maybe you find it useful:\n How to be a PhD student\n(to remind myself)\nI\nFind a place, no distractions.\nSit down. Be quiet.\nYou must depend upon\ncuriosity, courage,\ncritical sense – more of each\nthan you have – purpose,\nthirst for truth, exhaustiveness,\nfor consistent method\nis key to new knowledge. Reviewers\nthat accept your papers unchanged,\ndoubt their judgement.\nII\nThink uninterrupted thoughts.\nProgress, slowly.\nConvey your ideas clearly,\nshun your ego, this is not about you.\nLook through many lenses, be complex,\nthen build models, compress,\nuntil only those useful remain.\nThere are no uninteresting phenomena,\nno path not worth a look.\nThere is only the scope of this paper\nand future work.\nIII\nAccept what comes from data. Reflect.\nGet feedback, climb upon giants,\neven dwarfs can hoist you higher.\nAccept failures. You are normal.\nHave a rich life outside research.\nYet, write papers that disturb\nthe theories from whence they came.\n Of course, this is not half as good as the original. And you don’t need to agree with me – if you have some spare time, try to write down your own version of the poem, of what it means to be a PhD student, how to be it. Maybe the result is worth keeping visible somewhere in your work space.\nThe poem tries to answer the question of how to be a PhD student, but it says nothing about a different question that many people are facing these days: whether (with all that is going on) you should be a PhD student at all. To that question, for you particularly, I don’t have an answer – just some process advice: take, if you can, a few minutes of quiet time, turn off your phone, TV or any other distractions; look at your current life, right now (in whatever lockdown or “shelter in place” conditions you face), and calculate how much time you require to take care of your needs (physical and mental) and those of the people close to you; then, define for yourself how much time is realistically left, and what you want to do with that time: watch the news endlessly, or be a PhD student full-time, or something in between? is it a 50% load what you are willing and able to dedicate? 70% load? 20%? If what the poem above describes appeals in any way to you, if it is aligned with your values, see what portion of your life you want to dedicate to be it, title or no title.\nI’ll be right here, writing for those that answered yes.\nTake care. Stay safe and keep others safe.\nDid you find this more poetic, less research-y post useful? should I keep to the hard science stuff? what else would you find useful in these challenging times? what are you struggling with?

Or, we could choose to be productive. We could choose to develop a new skill. Being mindful allows us to notice, in a non-judgmental way, the richness of life in and around us (yes, even when you’re locked down at home day after day). In this new kind of post (the “quickie”), I give you in brief a few reasons to develop such mindfulness, and three ways to start learning that skill, today.\nThe eyes open, as the exhale slowly trails away. The blue light of dawn fills the buildings on the other side of the street, eerily empty of cars. A few steps to the kitchen space, a hand takes a white bowl and a couple strawberries out of the fridge with a clanking sound. The aroma of a banana being cut, the feathery noise of the knife like steps on fresh snow, mixing with the faint smell of muesli and turmeric and ginger. A few minutes later, I discover that I have blanked out, thinking about the post I wanted to write for the blog. The spell of mindfulness had broken.\nIn a previous post, I mentioned being mindful as one of the practices that keep me sane and non-depressed during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. It is also a topic many people are starting to be curious about. Students in our recent doctoral workshops on progress asked for more information and training on mindfulness, as a potential tool against the doctorate’s mental health challenges. Mindfulness has somehow become a trendy topic.\nThe idea of mindfulness as a crucial ability of the human mind, seems to originate in Buddhism and other ancient traditions. Sometimes defined as a “nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises in the attentional field is acknowledged and accepted as it is”1, mindfulness has been related to our (mostly mental) distress and suffering for millennia. However, in the past few decades modern science has also turned its tools to study this phenomenon and the effects of cultivating it. Thus, mindfulness has been applied systematically in therapy approaches against mental illness, or in training people to fight against chronic stress in daily life.\nBut, why should you be more mindful? what’s in it for you as a PhD student? Even in the relatively sparse doctoral education literature, we find evidence of its usefulness. One of its components, mindful acceptance, seems to be very protective against depression2,3, even if mindfulness practice itself was not correlated with less depression. And recently, a randomized experiment found that an 8-week mindfulness-based training seemed to have an effect on PhD students’ psychological capital (e.g., hope, optimism and self-efficacy) and their depression symptoms4, compared to a control group. Personally, I have been practicing mindfulness on-and-off for about a decade now, but only recently have become really regular. I have found it tremendously useful, not only to understand my own mind better, my triggers and response, but also to enjoy the smaller aspects of everyday life and be an overall better person (I think).\nYet, you might say: This mindfulness thing looks like a natural capacity of the mind. One notices things… or does not. There is little you can do about it, right? It’s like getting hiccups – you don’t really control it.\nOr do you?\nLike avoiding hiccups (which can be trained via diaphragmatic breathing5), mindfulness can also be trained. Here are three approaches you can try today to learn to be more mindful, depending on how much time you have available:\n Try a simple, short mindfulness practice, like eating a raisin or a short breathing meditation (follow the links for detailed instructions on how to do it). None of them will take more than 15 minutes, and they can give you a first glimpse of the richness and quiet that can come with cultivating this capacity of the mind. SoundsTrue has an interesting “mindfulness daily” free course, made up of very short talks/explanations and guided meditations, which you can do every day for 40 days. I did it myself recently, and found it interesting, even if you are a bit familiar with mindfulness practice. Very good if you are short on time, but want to develop the habit of doing it. The way I learned mindfulness back in the day, was through the Insight Meditation Center (a Buddhist center in California), which has several introductory courses on mindfulness. I quite like the pragmatic, practical and down-to-earth variant of Buddhism that Gil Fronsdal’s talks and meditations provide. Indeed, today they start one such course (via their live Youtube stream), at 9.30am California time, and for the next nine workdays. Probably a good introduction to mindfulness if you have one hour to spare these days.  These are challenging times, especially for those that are charged with protecting and healing us. Yet, for many PhD students (and researchers like myself), the cancellation of trips and many other things we spend time on, may have the unexpected side effect of clearing out some time. Once we’ve made sure that we are safe and we are not putting others in danger, we can use this time to learn new skills, or cultivate capacities you already have, such as mindfulness.\nFor some of you, if you have children or dependents at home, finding ten minutes of quiet can be an impossible mission. No one will judge you if you can’t… but still, maybe those time pockets do exist. Before everyone wakes up in the morning, or after they go to bed, or in one of those all-too-short naps they take. If you can, try out having a mindful moment, and see how you feel.\nTake care.\nHeader image by Mohammed Tawsif Salam via Wikimedia Commons\n  Bishop, S.

Doing anything related to your PhD seems unusually hard, or pointless… even dangerous, compared with being continuously in the lookout for the latest news or advice on what to do. In this post, I share a mantra and a few other tips that I use to help myself stay sane and (kinda) productive in these difficult times.\nAs of today, restrictions are still not too bad where I live (Estonia), compared to what I hear from places like Italy or Spain… at least, we can still go out on the street. Yet, even in this milder state of emergency, I notice sometimes a knot in the stomach, or my heart pounding faster than normal, tension in the jaw, or a sense of things being strange, surreal… And let’s not event talk about work performance (we’re working from home, of course): I’m not able to concentrate, I’m scattered, and progress seems painfully slow.\nFortunately, just before I convinced myself that I was experiencing some sort of virus attack, I looked “anxiety” up in Wikipedia and other psychological resources. Yup, that’s it, fits quite well. I’m just anxious.\nProbably you are, too.\nAnxiety is just a response to perceived threats, which we evolved for a very good reason (i.e., to make us get away from danger – and fast!). And we are in danger, with this virus pandemic going on, right? However, how can you get away from this danger? Many of us cannot even get out of home that much! Maybe here this particular evolutionary mechanism is not helping…\nThen, a couple of things happened to me.\nI heard this podcast where they talk about the difference between profitable (i.e., productive) anxiety and unprofitable one. To follow the same approach we saw in the \u0026ldquo;happiness in the lab\u0026rdquo; post series (first diagnose, then intervene), the way to diagnose what kind of anxiety you’re experiencing is simple: are these anxious feelings or thoughts compelling you to take a specific action that you think might help? if that’s the case (e.g., it is telling you to go and wash your hands because you just came from the supermarket), then go ahead, do that action, and probably you will feel better. If not, then probably you are having some kind of unproductive worry with you. How can you intervene to help yourself? One trick they mentioned in the podcast, which also came up in our recent workshops on doctoral progress, is to just stop and write down, in a piece of paper, what you’re thinking/feeling: “I am now having the thought/feeling that…”. Read it, and realize how it may be a bit overblown, or that there is not so much you can do about it right now. Fold it, put it in your back pocket, and get on with what you were doing. Chances are, you will feel much better.\nThe other thing that happened to me, which helped offset these fears, is that I read a quote that I found striking, given my frazzled state of mind. Striking, but also inspiring.\nThat is this week’s “Monday mantra”.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA short thought on fear and worry\n\r\r\rMost of our fears… never actually happen Looking around, it seems that the originator of this quote and its canonical form are not very clear. However, the main idea, repeated throughout history by multiple smart (and predominantly old) people, is clear: when we look at it retrospectively, it becomes clear that we tend to worry a bit more than needed, and that our track record as prophets of disaster is quite abysmal – either because the bad things we predict never end up happening, or because different bad things happen, for which we did not prepare.\nThis is not to say that we should not care about this virus at all (see below for more on that), or that everything is all right. It is not. Real people are dying, or having a lot of suffering from the disease, and millions of people are having smaller-scale problems, e.g., from being locked down all day at home. And the economic consequences of the virus for millions and millions of people across the world, are still to be determined. The situation is bad, in many many ways.\nHowever, once you have done what is in your hands (like, washing them!)… how much added value is there in constant worry and fear? Fear was very useful when our ancestors lived in the African savannah and had to run from predators. Nowadays, it pays to keep calm and use your brain, since the predator is invisible and cannot be outrun.\nThe mantra above can also be connected with many ancient philosophies like Buddhism and Stoicism1 which emphasize focusing on what you can control (e.g., practicing “social distancing” in the next weeks), rather than on what is outside of your control (e.g., people are dying of the virus!!).\nTips for a less-anxious PhD during the COVID So, if you (or people close to you) are fighting the virus, by all means, focus on your health and recovery. You have all our best wishes and support. For the rest of us, who cannot do much about others’ health and still can work (even if we have to do it from home2), here are a few tips that I’ve found helpful so far, which could become “mantras” on their own right:\n Be careful, not anxious. This is rule #1 – safety first. Don’t put your life (or that of others near you) in danger. Follow the guidelines established by your local authorities (e.g., these for Estonia3) or by respected healthcare entities (for instance, the World Health Organization or well-known healthcare universities like Johns Hopkins). But, once you establish what you need to do, and internalize the routine and habits to follow these guidelines, you don’t have to worry anymore. Just do it, and move on. Be mindful. From time to time, just stop for a minute, and notice how you are: are you tense, cranky, sleepy, headachey, tired, just fine…? Breathe three times. Meditate, if you find it helps you. The idea is just to be present here and now for some moments (vs. thinking about virus-related stuff), to check in with yourself and see if you have any physical or mental symptoms, virus-related or, more probably, anxiety and stress-related. This will help you decide what is the most skillful next action to take (be it to call the virus help line, or just to smile to that family member that you were finding so irritating a minute ago). Don’t consume media 24/7. Since we are at home most of the time now, the temptation is to fill all the time we’re not working (and some of the time we’re working as well – it’s so hard to separate them now!) with the latest news updates on the TV, the radio or social media. That scared voice in our brain whispers: Maybe our Facebook feed will give us the ultimate lifehack to remain free of the virus, if we scroll down long enough. These days, I try not to look at news at all, or do it in well-defined timeboxes. I actually prefer to look at not-so-newsy sources which still are updated daily: the Wikipedia page of the outbreak, for instance, is very complete, has links to country-specific pages that are also regularly updated, and seems quite focused on facts and free of sensationalism and politization of the virus. The other common temptation these days is to spend all your time on Netflix, Youtube and other entertainment platforms. This is not bad per se, but it can become the time sink of all your home confinement time. And, for some reason, I never leave these bouts of binge-watching or binge-gaming feeling refreshed and satisfied. To create some variety, you can also take a paper book and read it. Or, even better, create something. Compose a song. Invent a children’s tale for your kids. Knit a scarf. Create. Something. Stay in touch (digitally), reconnect. You may be forced to spend most of your time at home, alone or with only a few family members. Luckily, most of us also have ways to communicate, anytime we want, with almost anyone we know in the world. This is an everyday miracle we seldom appreciate. The lockdown will limit your social life in many ways, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need to kill it altogether. Take the opportunity to talk with people you seldom speak with. These days, I’m seeing family and friends in Spain more than I did when life was normal. Connect with a long-forgotten friend or relative. Probably, they will be at home and bored as well, and both of you will appreciate the conversation. Bonus points if you manage to give each other hope, rather than descending into a complaint-fest about how the world is gonna end! Sleep all you can. And try to keep a healthy lifestyle in general. Lack of sleep is known to make our immune system more vulnerable, and to bias our brain towards fear. During the outbreak, we have enough challenges in those two areas already, let’s not make things harder for ourselves. Doing a bit of exercise will probably not hurt either, as long as you comply with rule #1 (safety). Personally, I’m looking into bodyweight routines that I can do at home, to spend some of that excess energy from the lockdown, now that gyms are closed. And exercise will help you sleep, as long as you don’t do it late in the evening. Stay the course… but lower expectations. Maybe this one sums it all up: unless you are physically unable to do so, try to continue striving towards your goals, towards the things you value. Hopefully, your research and the PhD is one of those. Just be aware that, in the current circumstances, your productivity and energy may not be the same as usual. Be OK with that. Adapt to the new environment as you can, and go on.  Of course, I am not perfect at any of these practices. I still experience fear occasionally, and spend more time than I’d like in front of the TV or my phone. And my own productivity has kinda tanked. But it is OK. This is not about perfection, it is a practice, and we will get progressively better at it4.\nAs a species, we will survive this outbreak. And we will need research and researchers in the other side of it. We will need them more than ever in the future: not only in virology, but also in sociology, history, economics, technology, education… the knowledge we develop in all those areas can be crucial when the next global challenge presents itself. Stay the course, if you have that possibility. And if you don’t, just stay safe.\nTake care.\nDo you have other inspiring quotes, tips or tricks to stay productive and free from anxiety these days of lockdown?

This complex act of scientific communication involves balancing diplomacy with integrity, creativity and systematicity. In this post, I go over the concrete (and, sometimes, counter-intuitive) steps I follow to revise my journal papers upon receiving peer-review critiques, as well as some basic principles to increase your chances of success and avoid unnecessary suffering.\nIf you’ve been for some time into your PhD, probably you know the feeling: after what seemed like an eternity of writing, rewriting, getting feedback from your co-authors, rewriting again, dealing with the unexpectedly complicated formatting issues and a surprisingly medieval submission system, you finally submitted your paper to a good journal. Check. Hurray. Then, you just got on with your life: doing the next study, analyzing the next batch of data, reading and understanding a new corpus of literature that seems relevant… Several months later, when you had already forgotten about the paper, an email arrives: major revision. Or, even worse, reject and resubmit.\nOuch.\nThat big task you had so confidently checked (rather, that host of smaller tasks or milestones you had already passed), suddenly un-checks itself and bites back. You feel your heart sink. You question the whole idea of ever finishing this PhD.\nI have experienced this myself many, many times1. Lately, I have been seeing most of the PhD students around me going through this experience for the first time, and how hard it is psychologically. This post is just a way of saying \u0026ldquo;it’s OK to feel like that – everybody does\u0026rdquo;… but also that \u0026ldquo;this too shall pass\u0026rdquo;, and that publication is actually closer than it was when you had just submitted (even if it does not feel so now). If the response was not an outright reject, probably the reviewers saw value in the proposal. Manuscript revision is an essential part of the research process, of making our ideas and our papers better. And it works. Especially if you follow some basic principles and procedures, and put some time into it. Now, take some time familiarize yourself with the peer review process, if nobody has ever explained it to you in detail2, and read on.\nMy process for revising journal papers The experience of getting (often detailed and exhaustive) critiques for one’s work, and having to answer to them and make changes in a cherished artifact of ours, feels rather unnatural for most people. I know it was weird for me the first time. After doing it a few times, however, you get the hang of it. Below I describe, step-by-step, what I do these days once I get comments with major revisions (or rejections) from a journal. Naturally, the process and principles I mention are in a sense very similar to the ones I have for writing papers, just with this particular situation in mind3:\n Do an initial assessment. Even if you, of course, read the dreaded journal reviews email as it arrives, don’t do anything yet. Maybe wait for a couple of days to calm down4,2, as you will for sure feel very emotional in that first moment. Once you have a clear head, read the reviews slowly, calmly, and read your own manuscript (to understand not what you meant in the paper, but what you actually wrote)5. Then, think about what the critiques mean overall for your paper, and whether you want to submit your revised version to this same journal or somewhere else. Such changes in the publication venue are rare6, especially if we did our due diligence when choosing the journal at the beginning of the writing process. Yet, if the reviewers and the editors did not understand the contribution at all, and you find no fault in the manuscript’s clarity, maybe this is not the right community of researchers interested on what you do4. Send this initial assessment/opinion of yours (not more than a paragraph long) to your co-authors, along with the reviews and the manuscript themselves. See if they agree about what the reviews mean and what is the right course of action.  If you decide to go for a different journal, do not just resubmit the same original manuscript again! Still, consider the comments and make changes\u0026hellip; chances are, the same reviewers can get the paper again (as there is a limited number of experts in your particular paper\u0026rsquo;s keywords), and they will not be happy to see that you ignored all the effort they put into giving you advice. If you decide to go ahead and resubmit the paper in the same journal, be sure to set aside several good chunks of time to work on this revision throughout the next weeks/months until the deadline you and your co-authors set2. Really, block the time in your calendar already. Revising is often time-consuming and we tend to underestimate the time it takes. Then, continue to step #2.   Set yourself up for the revision. Read again the practical guidelines for revision that often come along with the journal’s response email you received (if that’s not the case, check the journal’s submission system, and see what format and options they allow for your resubmission). It should specify quite clearly how the response and the new manuscript should be formatted (e.g., whether they need a clean version of the new manuscript and another one highlighting the changes, etc.). Unless something else is said, the editors will expect from you a letter of response which details the changes done in the manuscript to address the reviewer comments (this letter is often forwarded directly to reviewers upon resubmission)2. Hence, start a new document for this letter with some boilerplate text, and copy after it, verbatim, the comments received from the reviewers, as well as the meta-reviews/comments from the editors themselves (you can find real examples from past papers of mine here and here, using either a narrative or tabular format for the reviewer comments). At this point, probably it is a good idea to label each comment clearly (e.g., “R1.1” for Reviewer 1’s first comment) for easier cross-reference. You can also include a prioritization tag, for internal use among you and your co-authors, stating whether each of the comments is voiced as a major criticism by the reviewers, or a mere suggestion for improvement (this will help you later to calibrate the effort and exhaustiveness you need in your responses and changes to each of them4,2). Outline the response and changes strategy in the answers document5. The key word here is strategy. Do not (I repeat, do not) start making changes right away in the manuscript. Take the answers letter/document you just created and, for every editor and reviewer comment, write down two bullet points: a) what would be the gist of your answer to them (e.g., “we agree”, or “we used the definition by …, which needs to be included”); and b) in general terms, what changes would be needed in the manuscript to address the comment (e.g., “add definition to introduction”). Don’t write a lot, but think a lot. Of course, as you go down the different comments, be attentive to synergies or contradictions between reviewer comments (can one same change address two of the comments? how can you address apparently contradictory comments?). Some authors suggest that, rather than going from top to bottom of the document, you may start with those comments you agree with the least, or those that are conflicting with another reviewer’s4. When devising these answers and changes, keep a clear, calm head, and focus on what can be the legitimate concern behind the comment (however hurting the form of saying it was). As one friend of mine often says, you need to look through the comments, not merely look at them7. How can you make your paper stronger or better, with that concern in mind?2 Once you have gist-answer and gist-changes for each and every comment, send this “answer/change strategy” document and the original manuscript, to your co-authors for feedback: do they agree? have you misinterpreted a comment? are there simpler solutions to address the comment? are your proposed changes likely to be considered insufficient? Your team should be clear on what needs to be done, before the messy work of revision starts. Iterate on the answers/changes strategy. As you and your co-authors progressively agree on the general approach to address comments, start adding a bit more flesh to the responses (what do you understand the comment means? to what exactly will you agree?) and to the changes you propose to do in the manuscript (e.g., write snippets of the new text to be changed/added, especially for the more tricky parts of it; find and add new references needed, etc.). But do this fleshing out on the answers document, not the manuscript (yet). There will probably be still interactions among comments, new ideas that that can come up as you read newer studies in relation to what was criticized, and it can be hard to keep track of all the changes in two documents at the same time. Needless to say, this step involves several back-and-forth exchanges with your co-authors, as they suggest specific strategies, phrasing or add details to what should go into the changes. Change the manuscript. Once the changes strategy (and maybe some particular snippets of new text) are clear and agreed, you can start doing changes in the manuscript itself. Sometimes, I do a first pass just locating the parts of the text that need changes, and I add just a comment there about what I need to do (e.g., “TODO: mention literature about X and improve argument line to highlight Y”). Then, I just go solving those comments by making changes in the text (remember to activate your word processor’s “track changes” or “suggesting” functionality!). Once you finish, if you have access to a professional proofreader (or someone more proficient in the English language than yourself), it is recommended that they give it a pass looking more at the flow and clarity of the text5. Finalize the answers document. Once you have resolved all the edits that were needed in the manuscript, come back to the answers document (which should be quite good already), and add the final layers of polish to it: check that the answers to reviewer comments are clear and polite (see the principles below), add concrete quotations from the manuscript to illustrate some of the changes done, add concrete locators and references so that the reviewers can find where the changes are located in the manuscript (e.g., “we have changed the arguments as per the reviewer suggestion, see section 2, 2nd paragraph/page 3”). You can see what I mean from the examples here and here. Then, of course, send both the manuscript and the answers document to your co-authors, for a final round of feedback. Final checks. Once everyone is happy with the new version of the paper, it is time to prepare the resubmission: check again the concrete guidelines for revision given by the journal, as well as the general formatting guidelines of the journal. Check out the journal’s online submission system, to see if you have all the files and information that you need for resubmission. At this point, it is common that the manuscript has grown to address the questions and comments from reviewers. If now the paper exceeds the expected length, include that fact in the letter to the editors, and be open to work on reducing it if the editors think that length is more important than what you think is fully addressing the reviewer concerns (that varies a lot from journal to journal). Any other critical issues or difficulties that you may have encountered while editing (e.g., addressing reviewer comments that go in opposite directions), you can also mention in that “letter” that opens the answers document. And then, just… Resubmit!  This process may seem a bit complicated, if you thought that revising a paper is just going to the document and making some changes. But, believe me, being systematic during the revision process is even more critical than when writing the paper. And that’s what research is all about, really. Being systematic.\nSome principles to keep in mind while revising In the same way that I gave my 10 Commandments of writing scientific papers, so that you know why the writing process is done the way it is (and to help you step out of the process and improvise with confidence, if necessary), here I also would like to give you a few basic principles to keep in mind while revising your journal papers:\n Be aware of your emotions. For a career in which one is supposed to put rationality and logic first, research is surprisingly emotional, as the effort we put into our work and ideas, makes us identify with them. Revising one\u0026rsquo;s own journal papers is maybe one of the most emotional parts of it. Hence, when reading the reviews and writing your responses, be aware of your emotions, and avoid situations that can trip you up4. If you are feeling enraged by the reviews (especially in the moment of their arrival), maybe it is a good idea to calm down, even wait for a few days, before re-assessing what was meant, what valid points may be hiding under those remarks, and going on with the revision2. How did I contribute to the problem? Related to the previous point, sometimes reviewers are wrong, sometimes they read in a hurry and overlook things that are actually written there. However, these “wrong remarks” also pose opportunities to make the paper better. Think about your future readers – chances are they will also be in a hurry, and they may also overlook what this reviewer passed over, or did not understand. Ask yourself if there are better ways to convey that idea, or to bring it to the forefront more (either through emphasizing, or repeating elsewhere, or using different, less ambiguous vocabulary). Since you cannot change their lack of attention, work on what you can control: the text. Do not be discouraged. One of the first emotions that usually pops up during this process of revision is dispair: you see a document in which a person (supposedly an expert in your field) is giving you a dozen reasons why your paper is bad8. It is normal to feel that your work is shit, and that you’re never going to finish this review, or publish this paper, or finish the PhD. But it’s not about you or your work – it’s just that researchers tend to be systematic people! (see #7 below). Reframe it as a learning, an improvement process4: you are making the paper better, more understandable for others, making your knowledge easier for fellow researchers to digest and build upon. If you got a “major revision”, cheer up! In my experience, those papers have a high chance of finally being accepted, if the authors put in the work (and follow these principles)4. Be polite and use evidence9. When you are answering to a reviewer, however lousy you think their review was, think about this: this is a real human being, fallible, but also generous enough to spend some time trying to understand and (hopefully) trying to help you make your paper better… and they are doing this for free, on top of an already busy schedule. Hence, treat them with respect, and think of them rather as consultants, not adversaries4. A brief “thank you” here and there will not hurt either2. If, in the end, you have to disagree with them, do it without being disagreeable: just point to the evidence that supports your position, while acknowledging that the other person may have understood otherwise. Collaborate: use your co-author team extensively during the whole process, to double-check your interpretations and strategies. Chances are that they have done this process quite a few times already, and they may know better what works, or some other tricks of the trade… if you give them the opportunity to show you. You can also contact the editor, even before the resubmission, if there are problems that make a good, exhaustive revision unfeasible (e.g., reviewers having non-compatible views of what the paper should look like, etc.). Iterate, iterate, iterate\u0026hellip; but do not touch the manuscript until later. This one is very unpopular, and a bit counter-intuitive. Why iterate? what one really desires is to finish this whole business, be done with it! However, as I do for writing the papers themselves, I firmly believe in the power of iteration while revising. We never get the approach, the idea, the argument, right on the first try. This is also why I advice to not touch the manuscript at the beginning: in this messy, iterative process, you are bound to put some things in the manuscript and forget to put them in the answers document, or vice versa. This initial strategizing will also help you detect and exploit synergies and commonalities between different reviewer comments. You may have the impression that the revision is stuck because you have not even touched the manuscript but, in my experience, you will spend less time overall if you wait and edit the manuscript once the answers and editing strategy are clear. For one, you will not need to delete stuff you wrote as often! (which is always painful) Be systematic, be exhaustive4. This capability to be systematic, to exhaustively look at every issue in your work, is one of the key researcher skills or attitudes, which we learn during the PhD. Once we address all the reviewer comments, we just need to show the editor and the reviewers all the work we’ve done5. This includes clearly labeling every comment, and cross-referencing them when needed, explaining what changes have been done in response to each comment, and where exactly to find them. This also involves looking for recent related literature that may have come out since the paper submission, and adding it where needed (some of it may actually help respond to the reviewers’ comments!). The only exception to this exhaustiveness may be the listing of every minute change that you probably had to do to make the whole paper flow and read well again, after all the changes; maybe just a couple of examples of this would suffice. The answers document need not be long just for length’s sake! Keep your integrity. By integrity, I don’t mean what is often found in the arts, the artist’s integrity that says “this is my work, and it should not be defiled by other people’s opinions!”. I mean the researcher’s integrity to find knowledge ethically and communicate it clearly. By following all the principles above, one can fall for the temptation to just stop all critical thinking and just do what the reviewers ask, word-by-word, even if it is clearly not the right thing to do. Rather, a researcher says “this is the evidence, this is the knowledge we got – let me explain it as best as we can, especially since people seem to misinterpret it in this or that way”. If you have to disagree with the reviewers, do so. Politely. Argue why you think it will not make the paper better (hopefully, using criteria other than just aesthetical taste), explain what is the intention you understood is behind their comment, and which way of addressing it you think is better than the one proposed by them.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rSteps and principles I follow to revise journal papers\n\r\r\rIn the figure above you can see a summary of these steps and principles journal paper revision. If those are too many or too hard to remember, don\u0026rsquo;t worry. I hope at least you will take this away from the post: Revising is a learning process, but it is not about you personally – it’s the opportunity to craft a better vessel for your ideas.\nHappy revising, and take care.\nDo you also have tips or tricks about how to revise journal papers?

In either case, you probably should be getting more of them. Sleep (or, rather, lack of sleep) is one of the best-known and most consistent risk factors related to depression, anxiety, and host of other mental and physical health issues. It is also one of the factors (mostly) under our control \u0026ndash; even if it often gets the back seat with respect to other priorities like work, social life, family, or the latest season of our favorite TV show. In this post, I review some of the (very extense, and rather terrifying) research about the effects that lack of sleep has on humans in general, and PhD students in particular. The post also points you to practices and resources to help you in sleeping not only longer, but also better. Keep your delicate mind and body machinery in optimal working condition!\nI still remember the most sleep-deprived times during my doctorate: just at the very end, when we had set a hard deadline to submit the thesis so that I could defend in time to apply for a postdoctoral fellowship I had my eyes on. Thus, I was rushing to write the whole dissertation manuscript in three months.\nWell, I don\u0026rsquo;t actually remember much from those hazy days myself. Mostly, I remember what others told me about that time: the few people that saw me during those three months say that I was just a shadow, a phantom of a man wandering occasionally around the house, barely talking. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen of others when sleep-deprived, probably that was accurate.\nI know for a fact that mine was not an isolated case. Several studies have shown a commonplace lack of sleep among graduate students: for instance, in a study of n=65 grad students in the US1, they reported sleeping an average of 6h40min each night, with a deviation of more than one hour (meaning that people taking less than 6 hours of sleep on average were not uncommon). A more recent study of 2,683 graduate students (including doctoral students) gave a similar average of 6.4 hours of sleep a night2. In a recent workshop with doctoral students, we asked them to actually track their sleep3 for a couple of days. Below you can see the distribution of answers of n=9 of them – the median value is 6 hours of sleep. And, of course, this is not a problem exclusive to PhD students: post-doctoral academics often suffer from the same chronic lack of sleep.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rDistribution of hours of sleep per night, as self-tracked by n=9 students in a recent workshop\n\r\r\rWhy everybody should sleep more OK, so let’s assume you are one of these (many) people who get around 6 hours of sleep each night. Is that really so bad? should you try to change your lifestyle and routines to add the additional recommended 1-2 hours? Hmmm\u0026hellip;, that seems like a lot of hassle… where are those hours going to come from anyways?\nMaybe one of the best responses to those questions is Matthew Walker’s book Why we sleep4. In this book, the neuroscientist and sleep researcher at UC Berkeley gives a sweeping view of the latest research regarding the physical and mental processes that are impacted by sleep (tl;dr: almost all of them), and what are the effects of sleeping less than the recommended 7–9 hours of sleep. Here is just a rapid-fire list of things skimmed from the book:\nIf you sleep less than a full night of sleep, you will…\n \u0026hellip; have more cardiac arrests (4–5 times more risk, if you normally sleep 6 hours or less)5 \u0026hellip; have higher risk of type 2 diabetes \u0026hellip; be more likely to develop cancer (40% more risk if you normally sleep 6 hours of less) \u0026hellip; have more risk of a car accident (almost twice the risk if you sleept today 5\u0026ndash;6 hours; 11 times more risk if you slept less than 4 hours)6 \u0026hellip; (if you are a man) have lower testosterone (similar to aging 10-15 years), lower sperm count (29% less) and smaller testicles \u0026hellip; (if you are a woman) have lower follicular-releasing hormones related to conception (20% less), and higher chances of suffering miscarriages in the first trimester \u0026hellip; have more genetic defects and more deteriorated telomeres in your chromosomes (which is related to aging) \u0026hellip; just eat more (after 10 days at 5–6 hours of sleep, we are hungrier and tend to eat 300 more calories, which normally don\u0026rsquo;t get spent) \u0026hellip; have worse effects from dieting (losing more lean muscle mass, rather than fat) \u0026hellip; look objectively uglier to other people (!?) \u0026hellip; memorize, and generally learn, less (20–40% worse retention for 6h or less of sleep) \u0026hellip; be more reactive to emotional stimuli, and be worse in decoding other people\u0026rsquo;s facial expressions (biasing your perceptions towards fear) \u0026hellip; work less productively (i.e. you will need more hours to do the same task), which in turn tends to lead to longer work hours, hence even shorter sleep, then even less productivity, etc. \u0026hellip; like your job less, be less motivated, lazier, and more prone to show unethical behaviors (yeah, why not tweak a bit those experiment results?)  Take a moment to think about it. Read the list again, if didn\u0026rsquo;t sink in. Do you really want all that?\nMaybe the most impacting aspect of the book for me was the amount of research indicating not just that “more sleep is better” (which is well known, but also quite abstract and does not compel me to change my habits and lifestyle). Rather, that researchers have very strong proof of the concrete, quantified adverse effects of even small quantities of sleeplessness: pulling a single all-nighter, or sleeping 6h a day routinely\u0026hellip; and how it multiplies chances of a car crash by 11!\nThe really terrifying thing is how widespread and ignored these effects/risks are (who has not done these things sometime during their thesis?).\nWhy PhD students should sleep more This leads us to another question: yes, lack of sleep can have bad effects on the general population (and probably some of that research above was done on non-representative samples, e.g., of undergrads around Berkeley). Is there really concrete, hard evidence that sleeping a bit less can really impact you, as a doctoral student, and your main goal right now (e.g., finishing your thesis)?\nIt turns out there is some research on that, too. Not a lot, but some.\nFor instance, in the previously-mentioned study of 65 US graduate students1, sleep was significantly (and negatively) correlated with stress (people that slept less, were more stressed). Another study of 136 French PhD students7 found that sleep problems were associated with symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety. Another recent study of 488 US grad students of psychology8 found that sleep hygiene habits (the practices that lead to a good night of high-quality sleep – see below) was more highly (and negatively) correlated with stress than other factors such as social support! Similarly, another study on 1,923 French PhD students9 found that the self-reported quality of sleep explained as much variance in the stress as all the other factors (sex, age, year of thesis, financing, satisfaction with supervision, physical activity) together10!\nHow to make your sleep better I hope by now I have scared convinced you that sleep is very important if you want to finish your thesis on time and in a good mental state. But, how do you get better sleep? it is not like anyone desires bad sleep.\nThe thing is, sleep is related to many of our lifestyle habits, which are surprisingly hard to change. As it turns out, humans appear to be the only animals that restrict their sleep voluntarily – and the modern world provides us with many temptations, opportunities and challenges which often take precedence over sleep, voluntarily or not (from unlimited amounts of entertainment at our fingertips, to bright lighting at night, or that noisy disco club downstairs).\nAs we did in the happiness in the lab series, here I also propose, as a first step, that you diagnose how much this is a problem for you. You can try one or more of the following methods:\n  The “quick check”: Do you tend to feel sleepy in the midmorning (10-11am)? can you function optimally before noon without caffein? If the answers were yes or no (respectively), probably you are not getting enough sleep and/or you are self-medicating it with caffeine.\n  SATED questionnaire: If you want a slightly longer check (but still under two minutes), you can try Buysse’s SATED questionnaire11, which gives you a simple “sleep health” rating between 0–10.\n  Sleep Hygiene Index: Slightly longer, and more focused on the idea of sleep hygiene (environment and habits that make good quality sleep more likely), you can try this questionnaire12 which already provides implicitly quite a few actionable ideas for making your sleep longer and of better quality.\n  40 Winks: If you have a bit more time to dedicate to this crucial aspect of your life (maybe 30 mins), you can try ClearerThinking’s 40 Winks web app, which integrates both a quite detailed assessment of your sleep quality and potential causes for poor sleep, and the giving of advice for habits that could help you with your sleep (often overlapping with the sleep hygiene concepts mentioned above).\n  Self-tracking and sleep opportunity: One of the aspects that maybe the self-reporting questionnaires above overlook a bit is the fact that we are not very good at giving accurate estimations of what we did in the past or what we often do (especially, if we are sleepy). This is also related with the issue of sleep opportunity: how much time do we really give ourselves to be in bed, not doing anything, ready to sleep. For many of us, insomnia is not the problem, it is just that we are too busy and we just don’t set aside enough time to sleep. One small practice that helped me diagnose this in my own life was to self-track my sleep on a daily basis. If you have a fitness tracker (e.g., a Fitbit or similar), you may already have this kind of data. Otherwise, just do as I do, and note down in your paper journal or a spreadsheet, every day shortly after you wake up, how many hours you gave yourself today to sleep. It may prove eye-opening when you summarize the data for, say, one month of doing this.\n  Once you have a first idea of whether sleeping is a problem for you, the next step is to act upon this information, i.e., change things in your environment or your habits, so that you can sleep better every night. This is the really tricky thing, as it involves quite a bit of self-awareness, self-control and, very often, negotiating with other people as well (e.g., can you get your flatmates or spouse on board to go to bed earlier?). Here are some ideas to decide what changes would be most effective for you:\n Just the notion of sleep hygiene as described in the SHI questionnaire can provide you with a good starting point: for which of the questions do you have a low score? which ones do you think are easier to change, taking into account your situation and environment? try changing those that best fit both criteria. Walker\u0026rsquo;s book4 provides an appendix with 12 pieces of good advice (which overlap a lot with the previous sleep hygiene tips). Among that advice, he considers the adherence to a constant time for bedtime and waking up, as the most important practice to enforce, if one has to choose (well, probably after giving yourself 7-9 hours of sleep opportunity, which is a necessary condition). As mentioned above, the 40 Winks app will provide research-based personalized assessment and suggestion of practices for better sleep, adapted to your particular situation. Worth trying if you have some time and you are serious about this (and you should be!). If you saw that your main problem is not so much hygiene but rather your sleep opportunity, my advice is to work on that specifically: look at your calendar/schedule, see what the main friction points are that make you go to bed late and/or wake up early; talk around with the people that have an influence on them… and continue self-tracking as you make changes in your life, to see if the amount of sleep you give yourself gets better.  \r\r\rGraphical summary of the main ideas of the post\n\r\r\rBack to the last bits of my thesis, in the end I managed to meet the deadline and submit my thesis on time… but it costed me quite some days of long work hours, and nights of short, poor sleep. Sadly, the postdoctoral fellowship I was aspiring to, did not come. Was it worth it to spend all that time tired and stressed over it? Or worse, would I have been more productive, would I have submitted a better application for the fellowship, if I had kept a more reasonable sleeping schedule?\nOne cannot but wonder.\nAre you sleep-deprived?

While this recognition (and the practices to \u0026ldquo;make progress visible\u0026rdquo; we saw) put a big emphasis on the student as the main active agent, PhD students are not the only actors in this play. Is there anything that doctoral supervisors can do to help? In this post, I go over some of the same management research on progress and our own evidence from the field, looking at what supervisors can do to support their students in perceiving continuous progress that eventually leads to a finished doctoral thesis.\nThe role of supervising on PhD students\u0026rsquo; progress One interesting aspect of Amabile and Kramer\u0026rsquo;s book1 (based on the study of diaries of 238 employees), is that it is aimed mainly to managers, to help them understand what their role really is in a team of engaged and productive knowledge workers. While PhD supervisors are not technically the students\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;bosses\u0026rdquo; (even if some academic research teams do work like that), I think there is a thing or two that we could learn from advising our PhD students with the issue of progress in mind.\nThe book authors\u0026rsquo; conclusion, contrary to widespread belief, is that the manager\u0026rsquo;s mission is not to \u0026ldquo;command and control\u0026rdquo;; it is not even to be the \u0026ldquo;team\u0026rsquo;s cheerleader\u0026rdquo;. After noting that steady progress is the most important factor in keeping the team motivated, they posit that the manager\u0026rsquo;s main role is to remove obstacles that may be stopping the team\u0026rsquo;s progress on its tracks.\nAlso, let us remember that the book phrases this most crucial aspect as \u0026ldquo;progress in work that matters\u0026rdquo;. While the work should matter to the employees, to the team (in our case, to the PhD student) primarily, we as supervisors are a very important social connection in relation to the thesis (as one of the few that can -hopefully!- understand the thesis topic). And social validation is one of the most important mechanisms that our brains use to assess whether something is important2. Thus, an important part of supervising PhD work is to signal such work as meaningful and important (or, at least, to avoid portraying it as meaningless). While we seldom fail at this intentionally, there are many ways in which a supervisor (or a boss) can inadvertently do so. These are what Amabile and Kramer call inhibitors and toxins (and their flip side, catalysts and nourishers).\nInhibitors are events that hamper, or fail to support the project\u0026hellip; and, in doing so, somehow imply that the project is not so important or meaningful (i.e., if it were important, everyone and the supervisor would be supporting it to ensure that it succeeds). Catalysts, on the other hand, are events or actions that support the development of the project. Examples of inhibitors and catalysts include:\n Providing clear goals for the work of the project (catalyst), vs. having vague goals for the work, or changing the goals repeatedly and without good reason (inhibitor). Even if, in a PhD, the students are often setting their own goals, we as supervisors can support students to formulate the goals and direction more clearly than they naturally would. Providing resources that are essential or helpful for the progress and completion of the project\u0026rsquo;s tasks (catalyst), vs. withdrawing critical resources from the project or its tasks (inhibitor). Two classic examples in the context of a PhD are measuring instruments or other research equipment (which maybe the supervisor can help secure for the student), and the supervisor\u0026rsquo;s own time and advice (which more insecure students may see as essential to the decision-making and progress of the research). The classic busy professor that is never available to meet and does not answer student emails\u0026hellip; do you think s/he is going to catalyze or inhibit progress? Similarly, having peers or other external people help with some part of the project can also be a catalyst (e.g., bringing in a specialist from another field to help with some obscure aspects of a data analysis), while extraneous blockages can quickly inhibit progress: for instance, when bureaucratic steps and administrative staff pose hurdles to the research tasks without an apparently good reason, what does that say about the importance of the research? Quite simply, just stating that a work is important, or noting explicitly the impact it\u0026rsquo;s having (or may have) on others and the students themselves, is another catalyst for progress. Even mentioning in passing that we see how the students are learning a new skill successfully, can help. Conversely, saying out loud that the project\u0026rsquo;s outputs are pretty much useless, is a clear inhibitor (since nobody desires to waste their time in something that is both very hard and rather meaningless).  Aside from these actions directed at the project/work itself, there are also actions that can help or hamper progress, by targeting the person doing the work. Toxins are negative inter-personal episodes which attack the worker (in our case, the student): when somebody yells at you, doubts your capabilities to pull off some task, shames you in front of others\u0026hellip; all those signal that you are worthless, and probably incapable of completing the project at hand (and hence, why bother?). Meanwhile, nourishers are positive inter-personal events which target the person: providing emotional support, encouragement, confidence in the person\u0026rsquo;s abilities, etc. These all signal your personal worth and ability to complete the work and, logically, can help PhD students continue putting in the effort needed to complete the thesis.\nOne more thing: the manager\u0026rsquo;s role is to remove obstacles that are extraneous (i.e., unnecessary) to the project. In research, some of our obstacles are intrinsic to the task, an inherent part of it: being systematic in our analyses, synthesizing multiple sources of knowledge and many other research tasks are hard, and there is no way around it. Hence, as supervisors we should do what is in our power to remove other obstacles that are not necessary, so that the hard work can be successfully done by the student. All this talking about removing obstacles is not about doing the core research work for the student (indeed, such behavior can in some cases be considered a toxin, since it signals that the student cannot do that core research task by themselves).\nFinally, when looking at these different kinds of events or actions that happen throughout the daily life of a thesis project, we should beware of a well-known bias that we humans have: the negativity bias. Put simply, this bias means that negative events weigh more than positive ones, in our hearts and minds3. That is why I\u0026rsquo;d focus my attention more on removing unnecessary obstacles, avoiding project inhibitors or inter-personal toxins\u0026hellip; rather than bringing in some fancy research resource (a catalyst) that is not essential, or throwing a party for the student (a nourisher).\nPractices to supervise for progress Aside from keeping in mind the general principles of removing unnecessary obstacles and signifying the doctoral work as important, is there anything else we can do as supervisors to help our doctoral students perceive progress and persist to finish the PhD? If you want to be more systematic about it, here are a few practices you can try:\n At the simplest level, you can point your students to learn about and implement some of the progress practices we saw in the previous post: making and celebrating smaller milestones, keeping a diary, self-tracking simple quantitative indicators, or working with objectives and key results (OKRs). Another very simple practice that I implement now in my own supervision is to just ask your PhD students about obstacles they may be facing. Sometimes the hurdles will be inherent to the task, or internal to the student (e.g., procrastination); sometimes the obstacles are unnecessary and should be removed\u0026hellip; however, as a novice researcher, the student is not always able to distinguish between these different categories. Nowadays, in every PhD meeting I have, after the students report on their latest activity, or when we are discussing next steps, I try to ask something to the effect of: \u0026ldquo;is there anything blocking you from moving forward?\u0026rdquo;. Sometimes, nothing comes up, or something arises that is out of my influence; but, sometimes, a short email or minor effort on my side can help unblock an unnecessarily-stuck situation. Keep up to date on the student\u0026rsquo;s work: In Amabile and Kramer\u0026rsquo;s book1, they recommend managers to be systematic in being informed about what is happening in the employee\u0026rsquo;s work. To help with this, the authors devised a \u0026ldquo;daily progress checklist\u0026rdquo;, a short reflection guide in which the manager can ask herself, systematically, about the team\u0026rsquo;s progress and setbacks, catalysts and inhibitors, nourisher and toxins that the team has faced each day. Again, take this advice, coming from a study in the US creative/innovation industries, with a pinch of salt. Maybe in your supervision practice in academic research, other frequency is more appropriate (e.g., weekly, or whenever you meet your students) \u0026ndash; many supervisors do not talk with their doctoral candidates each and every day. However, I think part of the point of the authors is for managers to increase the frequency of these information checkpoints. Hence, you can also try lightly checking in with your student a bit more frequently than you normally would. Maybe an informal chat or email will suffice, this is not about micro-managing or looking all the time over the student\u0026rsquo;s shoulder! This can also help signal that you care about the work; that it is important. Emphasize the learning process, not only the outcome: Another tip from the book on progress comes from the fact that some of the managers of successful teams were good at highlighting the learning process, the lessons learned from the work, especially in the face of a setback or failure. I believe this is especially important in a PhD, since a doctorate is, by nature, a learning process for the candidate. Hence, when the dreaded paper rejection comes, or an experiment fails, it is important that you, as supervisor, keep a clear head and guide the student in thinking through beyond the bad outcome or failure, to analyze the causes, what lessons have we learned from the failure, and what actions can be taken so that it does not happen next time. You can also think whether the negative results (or the lessons learnt) can be made into a contribution in itself4. I cannot underline this enough: failures are critical inflection points in a PhD. Make them into \u0026ldquo;teachable moments\u0026rdquo;, not breakup events! Have a \u0026ldquo;thesis map\u0026rdquo;. This is a tip that comes from our own field research talking with doctoral supervisors about progress. Some of the supervisors that reported being satisfied with their students\u0026rsquo; progress, mentioned that they had some sort of (implicit or explicit) \u0026ldquo;map of the thesis\u0026rdquo;: a meta-plan of milestones along the path to a thesis in their area/discipline, so that the supervisor can have an idea of how far along the way to the thesis the student is (and how fast it is advancing, or whether there are sudden blocks in such advancement). Typical steps in this map might include: doing a synthesis of the state-of-the-art, coming up with a research direction from it, and presenting at a conference \u0026ndash; during the first year; planning and conducting three experiments in the second year; etc. Naturally, this map or meta-plan varies a lot from discipline to discipline, and even for different kinds of thesis within a same area, so it seems that the supervisor has to devise this plan for themselves (I will probably explore this idea more in a later post). Although this kind of device has not been studied (to the best of my knowledge), it seems that having such a map explicitly in place would be very useful, both for the supervisor and for the student\u0026rsquo;s own perception of progress. It could even be used during the selection/onboarding phase of new PhD students, to make more concrete the workload, the breadth and depth of a PhD5. Finally, I\u0026rsquo;ll say it again: don\u0026rsquo;t make the students\u0026rsquo; work seem meaningless, if you can in any way avoid it. Dismissing the student\u0026rsquo;s ideas as absurd, imposing our own ideas/direction on the student\u0026rsquo;s project without their understanding it\u0026hellip; all may seem justified for the supervisor at some point of a thesis (but they are also indicators of students that later dropped out6). Ignore this advice at your own risk!  NB: this post is based on the materials for a new series of participatory workshops for supervisors that we are running at Talinn University (Estonia) and the University of Valladolid (Spain). If you (or someone at your university) think that these ideas could be beneficial for your fellow doctoral supervisors, feel free to drop me a line, as we are thinking about how, where and when to expand this emerging program, once we validate its effectiveness.\nDo you have other supervisory practices that help your students see the progress they make (or detect when they are stuck)? Does your supervisor use particular tricks to help you see how you\u0026rsquo;re progressing? If so, please let us know in the comments below!\nHeader photo: Advice on Keyboard, by www.gotcredit.com.\n  Amabile, T., \u0026amp; Kramer, S. (2011). The progress principle: Using small wins to ignite joy, engagement, and creativity at work. Harvard Business Press. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n To illustrate this, try to remember back to your teenage years, and the (now seemingly stupid) things that were life-or-death-important to you back then: your favorite rock band, wearing certain kind of sneakers, the approval of that \u0026ldquo;cool kid\u0026rdquo; in your class, etc. Back then, trying to detach yourself from your parents\u0026rsquo; points of view, social validation from your peers was almost the only mechanism at your disposal to understand what mattered in life. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n In some studies trying to quantify this, they came up with the measure that negative events count as much as 3-4 times more than positive ones! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Indeed, conferences or journals in some research areas are opening special spaces for such negative results, to fight the \u0026ldquo;publication bias\u0026rdquo; that threatens the validity of many of our findings. Shorter \u0026ldquo;negative results\u0026rdquo; papers in journals, or \u0026ldquo;failathons\u0026rdquo; in conferences, can be good venues to present such failed experiments, get a sense that the effort was not useless, and still help the advancement of your research area! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n One of the most common themes of PhD students that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen drop out (or consider dropping out) of the doctorate is the fact that they miscalculated the amount of work (and the kind of work) that a PhD entails. Many candidates enter with the idea that it is \u0026ldquo;just a longer master\u0026rdquo;, and are disappointed or disheartened when they see the amount of work needed, and the lack of very structured guidance that they are used to from their bachelors and masters degrees. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Devos, C., Boudrenghien, G., Van der Linden, N., Azzi, A., Frenay, M., Galand, B., \u0026amp; Klein, O.

If so, you are in good company \u0026ndash; most PhD students report such experience at one time or another during their doctoral process. The normalcy of this experience, however, should not make us dismiss it as unimportant. In this post I review research that speaks to the importance of this sense of progress (or the lack of it) to our engagement with work and the eventual completion (or dropping out) of the PhD. The post also reviews several everyday practices to cultivate your own sense of progress.\nBut, first, a warning: don\u0026rsquo;t be mistaken, feeling like your work is stagnating, that you are swamped in your progress, is not something that goes away once you get a PhD. Only a few years ago, well into my postdoc phase, I remember my despair after a long series of workshops and collaborations had lead to precisely zero results: the data gathered was not of enough quality, participants and collaborators were too busy to continue working with us, so the research idea I had been pouring so many hours onto, just faded away without any tangible result. My motivation was at an all-time low, and I was tempted to just lock myself in the office and do\u0026hellip; nothing. What was the point? I thought.\nIt took me quite a while to pull myself out of that hole, and I was surprised by how persistent and acute the feeling of demotivation and helplessness was, even if I knew rationally that such setbacks happen all the time in research. Only recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve read books and studies that have helped me make sense of that process I was going through.\nThe power of small wins In The Progress Principle1, Amabile and Kramer describe a diary study they did with 238 employees of seven creative/innovation companies of different sectors. During several months, employees filled in a diary entry about an important event that day at work, along with questions about their mood, productivity, and many other variables (including also assessments of their productivity by their colleagues and bosses).\nAnalyzing more than 10,000 of those diary entries, the authors noticed several patterns. Maybe the most important one was about the main distinguishing factor or event that appeared in a journal entry in a \u0026ldquo;good day at work\u0026rdquo; (as opposed to \u0026ldquo;bad days\u0026rdquo;): it was the fact of having made progress in their current projects or tasks, regardless of whether the progress was a big event (e.g., getting a million-dollar contract with a new client) or a small one (e.g., a programmer solving a small software bug that had been elusive for several days). Conversely, having a setback event, any event that signaled that their project was \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;going in circles\u0026rdquo; (e.g., the boss redefining the project\u0026rsquo;s goals, thus forcing the team to re-do the work of the last weeks) was a common marker of a bad day at work.\nThe authors are also quick to note that it is progress in work that matters (meaning, it matters to the person doing it)2. This does not necessarily mean that you are finding a cure for cancer, but it requires that the work is creative, challenging, that we feel it as our own (i.e., ownership), and that we feel it is consequential (i.e., that it will benefit us or others, be it because it will help us learn a new skill, or because other people will use its outputs).\nThis importance of feeling that one is making progress on meaningful work also manifests in what the authors call the progress loop: making good progress in a meaningful project generated good emotions (which is a reason people consider a day good); in turn, these positive emotions and perceptions of the work and the team made people more creative and more productive in the following days; and, of course, when people are more productive, they tend to make even more progress. Successful teams and workers were able to sustain this virtuous cycle for longer periods of time.\nOK, you might say, this is all very interesting, but this was a study on the industry, with employees of US companies, a very different environment to mine. I am a PhD student in academia in a different country. Why should this apply to me as well?\nProgress matters\u0026hellip; between PhD persistence and dropout Well, for one, I would say that a PhD has a lot of potential to be \u0026ldquo;work that matters\u0026rdquo;: it is creative, challenging, it is helping you acquire new skills (i.e., it is consequential for you, at least)\u0026hellip; and hopefully you feel that your dissertation is your own project. Nevertheless, the question of transferability of Amabile and Kramer\u0026rsquo;s results is a real one, which made me think: might there be some similar research done in doctoral education?\nIt turns out there is.\nThe research in question is a much smaller study3, in which 21 ex-doctoral students in Belgium (13 of which had dropped out, and 8 who had completed the PhD) were interviewed about their experience during the doctoral process. Among other things, the interviewees were asked to describe what a good day or a bad day in the PhD was like.\nThe qualitative analysis of the interviews noted that some of the usual factors that come to mind as important (e.g., PhD advising quality, or peer/colleague support) did appear a lot in the interviews. However, these factors were not appearing differently between participants that had completed the PhD and those that had dropped out. In some cases, doctoral students who had very supportive supervisors still dropped out for other reasons \u0026ndash; and vice-versa (e.g., there were people that had bad peer support or lab ambience, but still were able to complete the PhD).\nWhat the authors found was differential between PhD completers and non-completers mirrored very closely the conclusions of Amabile and Kramer4: the main difference between the experiences of students that completed the dissertation was their \u0026ldquo;progressing serenely in a project that makes sense\u0026rdquo;. Let\u0026rsquo;s unpack that sentence:\n A project that makes sense: Basically, students that finished the thesis were able to find a PhD direction, a project that made sense to them, and which they really considered their own (maybe not from the beginning, but at some point this \u0026ldquo;making sense\u0026rdquo; and ownership developed, or was somehow found). This is in contrast with doctoral dropouts, that described long periods of not having a PhD project at all, aimlessly changing its direction, and/or the direction not making sense to them (e.g., if the advisor had imposed a direction that the student did not understand or agree was important). Serenely: This simply means that the doctoral students did not experience too much (emotional) distress from working in the thesis. Even if all of them (completers and non-completers) describe times of struggle, in completers this distress was moderate, or did not appear all the time. People that dropped out often described feeling the PhD as a burden at all times, to the point that any task related to the PhD generated such distress. Progressing: PhD students that completed the dissertation described, in their good days, some sort of advancement in the preparation of the materials for the thesis (e.g., a journal article, a chapter of the dissertation itself, gathering data for a study, etc.). Of course, they did not necessarily experience this kind of progress every day of their PhD, but probably they did so frequently enough to keep themselves motivated. Conversely, students that dropped out of the doctorate reported long periods of \u0026ldquo;being stuck\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;going in circles\u0026rdquo;, and other forms of stagnation or even going backwards. It is also noteworthy that students seemed to evaluate progress quite frequently, expecting to see some kind of progress almost on a daily basis.  This last point (the frequency in which doctoral students expect to see progress) is especially important. If we think for a moment about the classic indicators of progress in a PhD (getting a paper published, finishing a study or a thesis chapter), and how often they appear (once every\u0026hellip; several months?), we can easily see why many doctoral students can feel uncertain about their progress, if they ask themselves about it every day.\nThat is a lot of uncertainty, for a lot of time. No wonder some just give up.\nA small bit of evidence from the field As we can see from the previous two pieces of research, there seems to be some evidence for a close relationship between our sense of progress in work that is meaningful to us, and our work engagement and morale. To test a bit this hypothesis in the context in which I work, we recently ran two workshops about progress in doctoral studies (one in Tallinn University, Estonia, and another in University of Valladolid, Spain). During the onboarding process for the workshops, we asked 31 local doctoral students about how satisfied they were with their progress towards the dissertation. We also asked them several questions from a validated questionnaire to measure their burnout (in terms of stress, exhaustion and cynicism5). The graph below shows the clear (negative) correlation between burnout and being satisfied with one\u0026rsquo;s progress. Students that reported low satisfaction with their progress also were more likely to report having considered abandoning their doctoral studies. These two pieces of evidence from an international, albeit admittedly limited, convenience sample, also seem to support the same ideas from the studies above: perceiving that you don\u0026rsquo;t make progress can lead to demotivation and, eventually, dropping out of the PhD6.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rNegative correlation between burnout and one\u0026#39;s own perception of progress in the PhD, from a convenience sample of 31 PhD students in Estonia and Spain\n\r\r\rCultivate your own progress loop The more I think about it, the more obvious this connection between progress and persistence becomes. However, one might be tempted to think that there is very little you can really do about it. You either make progress or not, right? Well, as with many psychological phenomena, the answer is yes\u0026hellip; and no. You cannot artificially manufacture progress for yourself without actually doing the (often difficult) research work that may lead to progress; what you can do is make it easier to perceive the progress that is already there, and which often goes unnoticed. Here are some practices that could help you with that:\n Make (and celebrate) minor milestones: This is the easiest one, which any of us can implement. Simply, make the granularity of your tasks (e.g., as you put them in the to-do list) small enough that you will perceive progress (i.e., you completed something) a few times a day7. If you put \u0026ldquo;publish my journal paper\u0026rdquo; as a to-do list item, you probably will not see progress in your to-do list for years; if you put \u0026ldquo;write a first draft of the introduction section\u0026rdquo; (or even an outline of it), you will probably be able to see some progress today. Of course, do not overdo it! Maybe \u0026ldquo;write a first sentence in the introduction\u0026rdquo; is not meaningful enough to give you any sense of accomplishment when you tick it off (and, at that level, you will spend more time fiddling with the to-dos than actually working!). Finally, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to celebrate your accomplishments: if you spent 25 minutes finishing some task towards your thesis, probably it\u0026rsquo;s OK to take 5 minutes off, stretch a bit, maybe put yourself a cup of your favorite tea, or just revel in the thought that you have laid one more brick towards the edifice of one of your major life goals. Otherwise, if you always just rush towards the next grueling task, you will never get the positive emotion of accomplishment that helps you be more creative and productive in the following tasks (remember the \u0026ldquo;progress loop\u0026rdquo; I mentioned above?). Self-tracking simple quantitative indicators of progress every day (or every week). One of the main insights of the research works I cited above, and other work in the field of supporting behavior change (i.e., doing more of what you want to do, vs. what we often drift into doing), is that making the desired behavior (or progress) visible helps. One way is just the good old to-do list, as per the point above. However, if there are specific aspects or habits you want to focus on (e.g., writing your dissertation manuscript), you could track explicitly how many times (or how much time) you did that particular behavior today (e.g., note down the number of hours you spent today writing your manuscript). You can create a table (see image below) in your journal, and fill it every day (typically, during your daily review)8. Then, periodically, you can review these tables and see how you are doing (and explicitly notice that you actually have been doing quite a bit of, e.g., writing, towards an important goal of yours). You can also use digital means like a spreadsheet to track these indicators, which enable doing graphs and other neat stuff with it. Indeed, we are starting to investigate technologies and practices to effectively support this kind of self-tracking for doctoral students, at my research group. Stay tuned for more about that!  \r\r\rAn example self-tracking table, from my own journal\n\r\r\r Google\u0026rsquo;s way: OKRs. If you want to go a step further and clearly connect your daily activities (e.g., write X hours every day) with higher-level goals of yours (e.g., finish three great thesis chapters this semester), you can also use a methodology for goal setting called \u0026ldquo;Objectives and Key Results\u0026rdquo;9. OKRs have been used by companies and individuals all over (from Google to U2\u0026rsquo;s Bono) to set and accomplish ambitious goals. I will not go into deep detail here (check the footnote above for more material), but the basic idea is this: you define an ambitious, inspiring objective (O) that you want to accomplish in this period (e.g., the three great thesis chapters mentioned above). This objective can be still a bit vague, but needs to be inspiring, something you put in a sign on your desk, something that makes you jump out of bed in the morning. Then, you define a 1-3 key results (KRs) that encapsulate how you plan to accomplish that, and how will you know that you have reached the objective. It is best if you look at the objective from multiple perspectives to define the KRs (e.g., I plan to write every day, I want to deliver things regularly to my supervisor for feedback, and I need to polish the text iteratively to get it to a good level of quality). The twist is that these key results have to be clearly measurable and time-bound. Thus, in the example above, the key results could be something like: 1) draft text for two hours every workday; 2) deliver a new draft piece every two weeks, for feedback; and 3) iterate every chapter three times with the supervisor feedback. Then, every week you can check back with your OKRs and see how far you have gone towards the inspiring objective, and whether you need to adjust something (be it your environment, your routines, or how you are working), in case progress in the KRs is not advancing at the expected speed. Journaling. One interesting thing that happened at the end of Amabile\u0026rsquo;s diary study was that the participant workers thanked the researchers for letting them do all the hard work of keeping a diary (and answering a ton of questionnaires!). They said that keeping the diary had helped them understand their own work much better: what worked for them, what didn\u0026rsquo;t, what things motivated (and de-motivated) them, etc. Indeed, taking a few moments each day to write down in a journal has long been reported as having beneficial, therapeutic effects10. There is indeed a long tradition in this direction in many fields of research: the lab notebook, where the researcher writes down the daily advances in the research, new conceptualizations of results, hypotheses, theories, etc. What should you write in your journal? It is a bit up to you. In Amabile\u0026rsquo;s study, the prompt was simply to write about one particular event from work that day, that came to mind. During my thesis, I often wrote about what new things I had learned about my research that day. I\u0026rsquo;d maybe have both: write something directly about the research work/content, and something about how was your progress and how you felt today about it. It is also worth noting that much of the learning that comes from journaling happens only when you review the daily entries at a later time (e.g., in your weekly review), and start noticing patterns. Don\u0026rsquo;t just write your journal, learn from it!  One note of advice about all these practices: keep them simple, brief, don\u0026rsquo;t overdo them (maybe track 4-5 behaviors every day, tops; keep the journal just a few lines/paragraphs, prompted by 1-2 questions, etc.), as there is the danger of spending more time fiddling with the tracking/journaling than actually working (or dropping it altogether, if it takes too much time). Let\u0026rsquo;s be clear: do not fool yourself into thinking that these practices will magically make the struggles of the thesis go away. They can help you advance, overcome the struggles, even enjoy them\u0026hellip; but the hard work of research still needs to be there.\nThat said\u0026hellip; Give them a try for yourself. See what works for you.\nBack to my own days of block, stagnation and lack of motivation after a failed research project\u0026hellip; slowly, I realized and accepted that such failures are a normal part of research life (albeit often invisible, as they seldom get published). These feelings of having made mistakes, of being a failure, are not the reality (an action can be a failure, but a person cannot). Rather, the feelings are rather a signal that something did not go well, that there is something to be learned here. Once I realized that something was not going well, the key was to take some action, changing what I did, how I did it, setting goals and plans in a more realistic and productive way. Having a diary and tracking my progress helped me make sense of the process.\nWhat about you? Do you have any tricks or practices to make your own progress visible, or to help others see their progress? Let us know in the comments below!\nNB: this post is based on the materials for a new series of participatory workshops that we are running at Talinn University (Estonia) and University of Valladolid (Spain). If you (or someone at your university) think that these ideas could be beneficial for your fellow doctoral students, feel free to drop me a line, as we are thinking about how, where and when to expand this emerging program, once we validate its effectiveness.\n  Amabile, T., \u0026amp; Kramer, S.

International Journal of Doctoral Studies. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Please note that these data from our workshops (and Devos\u0026rsquo;s study results) are just correlations which, as you know is not the same as causation (i.e., we don\u0026rsquo;t know if the lack of progress is making people burn out, or it is the burnout that prevents people from perceiving progress, or there is another factor causing both burnout and lack of perceived progress). The implication that lack of progress can lead to demotivation (i.e., more of a causal link) comes from Amabile\u0026rsquo;s work, which included temporal analyses in which progress (or lack thereof) preceded temporally work engagement, emotions and productivity (as something happening before another thing is one of the markers of the first thing causing the second). Still, even Amabile\u0026rsquo;s work just provides hints to that causality, rather than ironclad proof. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I chose the frequency of \u0026ldquo;a few times a day\u0026rdquo; purposefully: In Davos et al.\u0026rsquo;s study, they note that doctoral students were evaluating their progress (\u0026ldquo;have I accomplished something\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;) almost on a daily basis (\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; today?\u0026quot;). For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, I often tick between 3-6 tasks off my to-do list on a normal day. It can be more on a long, stressful, overworking day (but I normally cannot sustain this rhythm for long). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Not all behaviors need to be directly related with productive research outcomes (e.g., writing): for myself, I also track things like how many hours I sleep. These behaviors (e.g., sleep, exercise, spending time with loved ones) are not productive per se, but they can also be helpful in keeping your work rhythm (and your progress) sustainable. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Doerr, J.

During the Christmas and New Year\u0026rsquo;s hiatus, I had the chance to pause and review what has happened with the blog since I started it about one year ago. Read on if you want to know which were the most popular posts of 2019, where does this blog\u0026rsquo;s readership come from, and what lies in waiting for 2020\u0026hellip;\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\u0026lsquo;A Happy PhD\u0026rsquo; celebrates its first birthday! As I stopped and took a breath or two to review the closing 2019 (you also do quarterly or yearly reviews, don\u0026rsquo;t you?), I was amazed by the realization that one year had gone by since I started this blog. It feels like only yesterday I was reading through the latest research to understand whether studying a PhD made you more prone to depression, after a couple of shocking articles in the press, and a couple of personal episodes that highlighted the crucial (and often hidden, almost taboo) importance of mental health in academic research, especially at the beginning of it (this led to the first post in the blog).\nOver the past year, I have explored some of the latest research and advice on mental wellbeing for PhD students in 29 posts (this one is #30), along with other topics that I felt were important and not often talked about, from productivity tricks to conceptual tools to make sense of the thesis, or writing and communication strategies. Some posts were so long I had to make them into multi-part series; others, just pocket-sized reminders or mantras\u0026hellip; Not too bad, I guess, for a busy academic, but I have the nagging feeling that I could have written so much more, that I still need to dig deeper into so many unexplored topics (read at the end for some ideas).\nWhat topics did we learn about in 2019? here is the tag cloud of topics, with size representing how many times they have been addressed in posts (see here for a clickable version):\n\r\r\rTopics/keywords of the posts of 2019, with text size representing how often they have been used\n\r\r\rSome of the ideas, tricks and solutions featured in the blog also spilled over into The Real World™ (i.e., beyond moving bits and pixels in your screen), as I had the chance to organize or co-organize doctoral training events around some of the same topics mentioned in the blog. I found these trainings both real fun and tremendously enriching. For example:\n A workshop on productivity in the PhD, at Nelijärve, Estonia, in February A workshop on progress in the PhD, both for PhD students and for PhD supervisors, at Tallinn University, Estonia, in December1  \u0026hellip; plus, I also had the extreme luck to meet some of you in person, which allowed us to share both the few things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned along the way, and the challenges that many of you face as you try to complete your doctorates. I\u0026rsquo;m tremendously grateful for these opportunities and I will do my best to keep coming across them (and across you).\nSome numbers, and 2019\u0026rsquo;s top 10 posts So, there have been 29 posts in 2019, more or less one every two weeks. This is a lower frequency than I originally aimed at (weekly posts) but, on the other hand, I also got remarks by some readers saying that they have a hard time keeping up with all the writing I was putting out (makes sense, PhD students are normally a busy bunch). So\u0026hellip; maybe once every two weeks is not such a bad rhythm after all? if you disagree, let me know in the comments below!\nRegarding the readership, and according to my Google Analytics stats, throughout 2019 \u0026lsquo;A Happy PhD\u0026rsquo; got slightly over 10,000 pageviews, from a bit less than 4,000 different users. The real shocker for me was the fact that, among these readers, I could find people from up to 112 countries (!). I\u0026rsquo;m really humbled and grateful that some of the ideas I was tentatively putting out there, have reached so far and wide. Out of these 112 countries, the top 5 countries where most of you come from (or rather, accessed from) seem to be: USA (18%), Spain (13%), UK (5%), Australia (5%), and Estonia (4%). We can see a big-English-speaking-country bias (to be expected, since the blog is written in English)\u0026hellip; plus Spain and Estonia, the two European countries where I have spent most time doing research (and I have the most contacts from).\nJust for fun, I also compiled the most popular posts of 2019 (i.e., the ones with most views, normalized by the time each of them has been up \u0026ndash; of course, the older posts have been visited more in absolute terms). These are, in descending order of popularity:\n Pitching your research ideas with the NABC method \u0026ndash; a simple method to structure your research presentations or \u0026ldquo;pitches\u0026rdquo; Will you drop out of the PhD? or should you? \u0026ndash; a revision of the most important factors associated with dropping out of the PhD PhD tool: The CQOCE diagram \u0026ndash; a conceptual tool to have a clear, overall view of your thesis work Productivity tip: How I do weekly reviews \u0026ndash; one of the most underrated productivity techniques, to help you find a sense of progress, crystallize what you learn, and keep you focused on important goals Report from the trenches: of calendar tricks and time scarcity \u0026ndash; a report on my trying out of a new productivity trick I learned recently, ditching your to-do list altogether and using your calendar app as a substitute Productivity tip: the Pomodoro technique \u0026ndash; my take on the classic technique to find focus and stop procrastination, and how to use it in the PhD How to deal with to-do list overwhelm \u0026ndash; going over several practices to tackle one of the most common productivity problems of many PhD students (and academics in general), including the trick I mentioned in #5 above Writing tips: How I write papers (Part I) \u0026ndash; Part of the series on how to write scientific papers, this post describes how I start (collaboratively) writing my papers, from the initial idea to a good outline of the contents Happiness in the lab, part 5: Kindness \u0026ndash; The closing post of the series on the science of happiness at work, dealing with how to develop kindness to enrich your research work Choosing not to drop out: A view from self-determination theory \u0026ndash; Another post on research about doctoral dropouts, focusing on some of the factors that you actually have control about  \r\r\rThe 10 most popular posts of \u0026#39;A Happy PhD\u0026#39; in 2019\n\r\r\rWhat lies ahead for A Happy PhD The \u0026ldquo;top 10\u0026rdquo; above shows that people are interested in all the different areas I touch upon with the blog (doctoral productivity, wellbeing, transversal skills). Hence, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I will change radically the direction of the blog for now. There are, however, a few novel things I would like to try in 2020, including:\n Increasing the number of live training events (e.g., workshops for doctoral students) about the issues and ideas developed in the blog. These are enormously fun, and allow me to better understand PhD student struggles, and also their resourcefulness. Do you think your university or doctoral school would be eager to host such an event? Feel free to drop me a line and let me know. Doing a bit of actual research about how to support PhD students in better progressing towards the dissertation. This includes both what to do (practices), and also some tools and technologies that may be helpful in the process. We are already running PhD student and supervisor workshops in Tallinn (Estonia) and Valladolid (Spain), to better understand the problem and solution space. I will keep you posted on these ideas, our findings and any experimental piloting we open, on later posts! I\u0026rsquo;ll try to make posts themselves more regular (weekly, maybe?), but also shorter and to the point, to cater for your typically busy schedules. I also would like to expand the audience of the blog, so that these (hopefully useful) ideas reach as many PhD students as possible. Yet, I am no social media expert here, so any advice or suggestions on how to best grow our little community, will be very welcome ;) And, of course, I would like to continue learning new things about doctoral studies and doctoral supervision, and how to help others complete (and enjoy) that journey. I would like to explore and dive deeper into topics I was not able to address in 2019. Topics like: the influence of sleep, mobile devices, or mindful acceptance, on our health and productivity as researchers; different doctoral supervision styles and their relative effectiveness; impostor syndrome, fear of planning and other common candidate foibles; useful everyday practices, from journalling to effective thesis meetings with your supervisors; more mantras; more thesis conceptualization tools; more self-experiments on productivity (to try for myself, or for yourselves to try), and so many more\u0026hellip;  It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a fun year.\nDo you have other ideas for post topics, long-ranging series, short mantras, productivity tricks or deeper dives, which could help your fellow PhD students or supervisors?

In this month\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantra\u0026rdquo;, I give you not one, but two sentences that you can use to remind yourself to manage this resource wisely. Choose your favorite!\nThe other day I was waiting in the line for lunch, at one of the campus cafeterias. Instinctively, I reached out to my pocket to grab the phone and check my email. Halfway through that motion, I caught myself doing it. Wait, why do I want to check the email? I just checked it five minutes ago! Then, I looked around me and I saw most of the people in the line doing the same, face down, hand in front of their faces\u0026hellip; sounds familiar?\nMany small episodes like this one, have put the issue of attention on my mind lately: seeing people doing their email while doctoral students were presenting their work to get feedback (I was guilty of that myself!); a colleague telling me how wonderful it was to go for a walk in the forest\u0026hellip; once she removed her headphones and listened to the sounds of nature; reading this article on the relationship between creativity and distraction; etc. As I become more and more aware of the role of attention in so many of the activities we consider important, I thought it would be great to share a couple of \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantras\u0026rdquo;1 to see if they help you as well.\nThe gift of attention \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rHow to handle attention\n\r\r\rI don\u0026rsquo;t remember where I found this sentence for the first time. Probably I\u0026rsquo;m butchering some kind of Zen or motivational guru quote, but there is something striking about it \u0026ndash; maybe this idea of attention as a gift.\nSome people say that \u0026ldquo;time is the ultimate luxury\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the ultimate currency\u0026rdquo;. And it is true. Time is all we have. You can make more money, but you cannot make more time. And still, we are \u0026ldquo;killing time\u0026rdquo; every day, we somehow give it away (to Facebook and the other tech giants that transform our engagement into money via advertising) every time we have to wait in a queue, or commute, or just walk around. We are, in a very real sense, \u0026ldquo;paying with our attention\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; even if we are not sure of what we are getting in return for the payment.\nFor me, the mantra above is a reminder that, maybe even more than time, attention is something precious. Our cognitive capacity for attention is limited: out of the 24 hours on a day, there is only a handful of hours where you can really be attentive, focused. There is an old Spanish saying, \u0026ldquo;time is gold\u0026rdquo; (el tiempo es oro). Well, then think of attention as a gem, a jewel, something even more valuable than gold, which we can gift to people (our friends and families, a colleague in need of feedback, etc.), or to problems that are important for us and we want to solve. Give your attention wisely.\nYou only have so many of those gems.\nManage your bandwidth \r\r\rAn alternative to time management\n\r\r\rThis other mantra says pretty much the same thing, but in a more \u0026ldquo;managerial style\u0026rdquo;. It seems to come from this article by Sendhil Mullainathan (whose book I also mentioned in the last post on time scarcity). Basically, the idea is that our capacity for attention and thinking things through is limited, varies over time (e.g., in the mornings vs. after a heavy lunch), and gets occupied or depleted by things in our life: from meetings or difficult decisions\u0026hellip; to any problem we have in our lives (e.g., being a good parent when your kids are being irritating, or not having enough money to make ends meet at the end of the month). However, we seldom think that the small things we do (like reading my email in the cafeteria queue) also consume our attention. Am I really expecting an important life-or-death email when I reach for my phone? most often, the answer is no.\nIt turns out that these down times, doing really nothing (vs. occupying our minds scrolling through feeds) is also strongly related with creativity and creative problem solving. People that have some time to mind-wander doing easy tasks are better able to solve difficult problems that require creative thinking later on2. The constant availability of distractions (in our computers, in our phones) is obliterating the amount of brain idleness (and, why not, boredom) that we experience on a daily basis. How might this be affecting our ability to think and solve problems creatively?\nSo, if you want to manage your attention and bandwidth better, and exploit mind-wandering to be more creative, here are a few tips gleaned from the articles above:\n Assign tasks in your calendar being mindful of your bandwidth and how it varies throughout the day. For me, the best times are the mornings, so I try to do my creative work then (writing, designing studies, preparing teaching), guarding it from other tasks like meetings or email. Similarly, be self-aware of your current levels of bandwidth: if you are tired after a day full of meetings, or you are preoccupied by some personal problem, be extra-careful when interacting with others (maybe this is not the time to discuss some tense pain-point with your spouse), and avoid taking important decisions until you have the bandwidth to think about them clearly. To create a bit of idle time (and hopefully boost your creativity later), just go for a long walk3 without your smarphone (gasp!). Parks and nature are great places to go, if you have them nearby. In general, try to alternate between focused activities and idle or less cognitively-demanding tasks. Maybe dusting your furniture, or playing with your dog\u0026hellip; not doing email or Facebook-scrolling: they require much more attention than you think!  All work and no play\u0026hellip; Maybe just one last idea before I wrap-up: so far I have talked a lot about how attention and bandwidth and idle time are important\u0026hellip; for your productivity. But not everything in life is about being productive (I am often guilty myself of thinking like this). And there is a certain danger in focusing on productivity all the time.\nMake some space in your life for fun and games and idleness\u0026hellip; because they are fun!\nTry it next time you are in a queue. Instead of reaching for the phone, do nothing special. Nothing. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect anything to happen (it often doesn\u0026rsquo;t). Yet, in my experience, strange ideas (a cool present you could gift your auntie for her birthday; a new data analysis to try on your latest experiment) sometimes do appear in these increasingly scarce moments of really doing nothing.\nWhat about you? Do you have any tricks or routines to manage your attention? Have you tried to spend more time idle but undistracted and, if yes, have you noticed any effects? Let us know in the comments below!\n  If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantras\u0026rdquo; are or how to use them, please read the original post I wrote about them.

Nice, let\u0026rsquo;s continue\u0026hellip; \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Mind-wandering seems to be something of a double-edged sword: doing a lot of it has been related with things like depression (e.g., if your mind wanders to ruminating on problems or unhelpful self-talk), but a little of it apparently aids creativity.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying this productivity trick on myself for the past few months. In this new kind of blog post, I report on the results of this self-experiment, and the effect it has had on my own productivity and wellbeing. I also provide some practical tips and tricks, in case you want to try it out for yourself. TL;DR: It works\u0026hellip; if you are a bit careful.\nReports from the trenches I have been blogging here about productivity and wellbeing in the PhD and academia for about a year now. This might make you think that I must be very productive and super-happy myself, right? Well, not really, and not always. I am, however, deeply interested in these topics, including how they apply to my own situation. So, aside from reading a lot of research and other materials on these issues and writing about them, I also try them out for myself, to see what are the effects. I do a lot of self-experimentation.\nWhy?? Don\u0026rsquo;t you trust the findings of researchers or the advice of experts?\nWell, yes, I do \u0026ndash; but I am also wary of the wide inter-subject variability that many of these studies show. We are all different in so many ways (from genetics to education, culture, or life experiences), and we live in unique circumstances. Take, for example, the effects of mindfulness meditation to reduce the stress and anxiety of PhD students. If you read a recent study like Barry et al. (2018), you see that the researchers found a statistically-significant reduction in depression symptoms\u0026hellip; on average. However, if you look at the spread of the difference in depression symptoms before-after the mindfulness course, you can see that, even if the average effect is positive, it is also not uncommon to find participants for whom the effect was actually negative. For me, the average positive effect marks that it is something worth trying, a starting point or a working hypothesis. But, what if you had been one of the negative-effect people? would you still take up this practice? I bet you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ndash; and for a good reason. That\u0026rsquo;s why I like the old Buddhist idea of not just going by reports, and trying for yourself.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the idea of this new kind of post in the blog (the \u0026ldquo;report from the trenches\u0026rdquo;): I try out some of the practices and ideas that I have mentioned in the blog, apply them to my own life, and report briefly and informally about the results, in the hope that this will help you out1. This, of course, is no guarantee that these tricks, these practices, will work for you. It may only provide a (very small) bit of additional evidence, and give you some ideas on how, or where, to start.\nOf calendar tricks\u0026hellip; The context. For the past few years, I considered myself a reasonably organized person. However, there was one thing that was bothering me somewhat: in my weekly and daily reviews, I noticed that many of my TO-DOs, even the few ones set to be done for a single day, were still undone by the end of the day, or delayed for another day (often indefinitely). Furthermore, my \u0026ldquo;general to-do list\u0026rdquo; of things I wanted to accomplish, continued growing and growing. This, of course, meant that I was routinely miscalculating the time it took to do things, which led to over-committing, which in turn led to a vague feeling of anxiety and overwhelm, which I tried to ignore. Then, in a productivity workshop we ran in a winter school for doctoral students, this visiting professor gave us the idea (which had served him well for years) of ditching TO-DO lists altogether and just using the calendar app to hold all tasks, with an associated time slot (see the previous post where I mentioned this, and also below).\nWhat I was doing before (just to clarify the change before/after the experiment). Basically, I was using my calendar app (Google Calendar) to store mostly meetings and appointments2. Then, I had an overall (and quite long) TO-DO list with all the tasks I needed to do in the future (these were rather concrete tasks and projects I had committed to doing, not vague things I wanted to do someday maybe\u0026hellip; those were kept in a separate list). Finally, according to Levels 1 and 2 of the practices to avoid TO-DO list overwhelm, I did a smaller list of tasks for the present day (drawing from the overall TO-DOs, or recent emails, etc.), marking 1-3 of them as the Most Important Tasks (MITs). This smaller list I normally kept on my notebook (which I try to keep with me when I\u0026rsquo;m working).\nWhat I have done during the experiment. About eight months ago, I did the switch to the Level 3 practices in the aforementioned post. I emptied my overall backlog of TO-DOs, assigning them a time and a duration, and adding them to my calendar. For those tasks that were too large or too vague to put in the calendar, at least I put a slot in the calendar to scope the project and decide next steps/tasks to do about them (which would again go to the calendar). Then, I burned that cursed, overlong list that had been haunting me for years (well, no, I actually threw it to the recycling bin) \u0026ndash; and, boy, did that feel good! Now, every new task I need to do, every new request, everything, goes, with a starting and ending time, into the calendar some concrete day in the future. If it is very urgent and I need to do it on a fully-booked day, then something has to go out, or be moved to another free slot/day. That simple. Quite importantly, I also update the calendar during the day (up to the closest 15-minute chunk, don\u0026rsquo;t overdo this), to reflect what I actually did, and the times when I actually started and ended the task (more on this later). This means that I have to keep the calendar handy at all times when I\u0026rsquo;m working3. Interestingly, I still keep the tasks and MITs for the day, taken from the calendar, in my paper-based notebook \u0026ndash; even if it is redundant4. How does my calendar look like now? Please compare the two screenshots below, from before and after the change:\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rHow my calendar looked before (left) and after I started employing the calendar to store all my TO-DOs (right)\n\r\r\rBut\u0026hellip; does it work? The good. There are quite a few things I found beneficial about this new approach:\n I am getting much better at planning realistically my days, and also at understanding how much time different kinds of tasks actually take (e.g., I was under the impression that I could review a paper in about one hour; now I know that it is more like 4-8 hours, depending on the paper\u0026rsquo;s length). I\u0026rsquo;m still not perfect at this, but for sure much better than before. I over-commit less. Related to the previous point, now I am painfully aware of my productivity limitations. Together with the fact that there is a limited number of hours in a day (and a limited number of hours I want to work in a day, in order to stay sane and productive), now I have a clearer idea of what I can achieve by when. When an invitation for a project or other \u0026ldquo;optional task\u0026rdquo; comes my way, attached with a deadline, I can make a clearer judgment and decline it, if that\u0026rsquo;s the appropriate thing to do. It is visual. At a glance, I can see how a certain day or week looks like in terms of busyness, and take quick decisions. Much better than just looking at the number of TO-DO items, which have no durations associated with them. Another beneficial effect, which I had not anticipated, is that this method hides a lot of the anxiety-inducing complexity and endlessness that the ever-growing TO-DO list was inducing (as long as you keep yourself in \u0026ldquo;Week mode\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Day mode\u0026rdquo;, you never see the fact that you have tons of tasks pending \u0026ndash; just don\u0026rsquo;t go into \u0026ldquo;agenda mode\u0026rdquo;!). As they say, out of sight, out of mind. It is just simpler. I have to keep track and maintain one less list (the big overall TO-DO list, which had to get pruned periodically to fit into a reasonable size, is now gone). I now have quite good data about what I do with my time. If later on I want to report my activities, or re-evaluate if I am spending too much time on, say, meetings, I can easily check the calendar and see if I\u0026rsquo;m deluding myself, or exactly how bad is the problem.  The bad. No trick is without its costs and downsides, and this is no exception:\n There is a cost to keeping the calendar running like this, moving blocks of time around every time there is a change of plans or a new thing comes in. Especially, there is a cost to adjusting the time slots to what I actually did (vs. my original plan) several times during the day. But normally this cost is on the order of seconds. You need to have the calendar on view or quickly accessible at all times (so you may need to re-structure some of your routines, how you work, etc.). In my case, changes were minimal, since I was already using the calendar app quite frequently before the switch. Similarly, you become tremendously dependent on your calendar (all my knowledge of tasks, appointments, etc. gets offloaded to that app \u0026ndash; so I don\u0026rsquo;t remember anymore anything about those by myself, almost). Your calendar has become a single point of failure (e.g., if you somehow delete it, or it is not accessible for whatever technical reason). That is maybe why I keep the daily tasks also on the paper notebook: as a (redundant) backup solution (at least, for what I wanted to do today) in case I don\u0026rsquo;t have the calendar at hand. I still over-schedule myself. The impulse to say yes to whatever comes my way still remains. I have fallen prey to the \u0026ldquo;I could fit that in, if I make this and this slot a bit shorter\u0026rdquo; syndrome sooo many times\u0026hellip; However, reality kicks back in quite quickly, and by the end of the day I can see in the (updated) calendar that things still take the time they take, and inserting the new thing just kicked out something else (or made my hours longer than I want them to be).  The ugly? I have the indefinite feeling that this fiddling with slots in the calendar all day can lead to a loss of \u0026ldquo;big picture perspective\u0026rdquo;, as I focus a lot on the one-hour slots, rather than the multi-day projects that are important, but not urgent. Another interesting (or, should I say, insidious?) effect of this way of working is that it makes you acutely aware that your time is scarce. And this kind of realization (and the daily reminder that the calendar represents) is, apparently, a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the focus on the scarce resource sharpens your ability to manage it (i.e., I do feel like now I am more efficient with time, more aware of the trade-offs involved in accepting a new task, maybe because I am looking at a graphical representation of my time frequently). But, on the other hand, it also leads to a sort of \u0026ldquo;tunnel-vision\u0026rdquo; in which only the immediate danger to that resource is paid attention to (e.g., this week\u0026rsquo;s deadline, or cramming as many tasks as I can into today), in detriment of longer-term tasks, projects or behaviors. This is best explained in a book I read recently (Scarcity, by Mullainathan and Shafir5), which details several studies on how resource-deprived people tend to act in ways that we consider unwise, and why that may be. Quite an interesting read, from which I gleaned a few ideas (some of them mentioned in the actionable tips below, others to come in a separate post on our ubiquitous \u0026ldquo;time scarcity\u0026rdquo; in academia and research).\nThe verdict\u0026hellip; and some actionable tips So, should you try it or not? Overall, I\u0026rsquo;d say yes, the benefits outweigh the downsides for me, today. I plan to continue using it, and continue learning about my planning skills (or lack thereof) and over-commitment. However, anyone trying this should be mindful of the downsides I mentioned above. In case you want to try it out yourselves, here a few tips for making the most of it:\n Learn how to use your calendar app effectively. As with any craft, know your tools. Use different calendars (with different colors), not only for work vs. personal stuff (e.g., the purple vs. blue boxes in the pictures above), but also for joint specific projects or areas you may share with colleagues (e.g., my teaching and its preparation goes into a separate, red, calendar I share with my fellow co-teachers). Divide your tasks further into sub-calendars if you want to (e.g., for reading, writing, fieldwork tasks, etc.), so that you can see the week\u0026rsquo;s balance of different kinds of work just by squinting your eyes when looking at it. But do not spend too much time fiddling with this and making it \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo;. Set something up in the beginning, and start working with it as soon as possible. The first step of setting up and moving your tasks there is the most painful one! Pair the calendar trick with weekly and quarterly reviews. While the calendar trick has helped me greatly in managing day-to-day work and making it more efficient and realistic, it can make you hyper-focus on fighting fires and churning out tasks that, at the end of the day, may not be that important. One antidote I found useful to get back the \u0026ldquo;big picture view\u0026rdquo;, is to be consistent with the habit of doing a weekly review (where you look at your longer-term goals and block time in the upcoming week\u0026rsquo;s calendar to tackle them). To make these weekly reviews work well, you need to have spent some time thinking out of your weekly calendar, gaining an even longer perspective \u0026ndash; which is why I also do quarterly and/or yearly reviews, where I set goals and important projects for even longer time horizons (another post on those coming soon). Don\u0026rsquo;t get too obsessed. Yes, in this blog I seem to be all about productivity and such things, but do not overdo it to the point that you are more stressed by striving towards efficiency, than you were by being inefficient. During work trips, when my schedule is defined externally, I often do not use the calendar in the aforementioned way. Do not schedule your personal tasks and hobbies to-the-minute (but block time for those if you find it is too easy to forget them). I also do not schedule my holidays or any quality time I want to spend with family and friends. Leave slack. This is one of the main actionable lessons from the Scarcity book: for some systems to work properly, they need some slack (i.e., free, unused capacity). This is especially true when we know that unexpected events and shocks are actually frequent (e.g., new tasks popping up, a colleague stepping into our office asking for help, etc.). I find that my days are most realistic (and satisfying) if I leave 1-2 unscheduled hours to deal with the unexpected (see the picture below)6. This slack does not include the pauses for lunch, the leaving of 15 minutes between meetings (to get out, go to the bathroom, stretch your legs, etc.), or taking into account (amply) that you have to move around to get to your next appointments (sometimes, to different parts of the city). All this slack may seem wasteful, but it is a necessity if you want to avoid the \u0026ldquo;time scarcity mindset\u0026rdquo; and the classic planning fallacy (don\u0026rsquo;t worry, many other tasks will probably take more time than expected, and will happily consume that slack). And, if you eventually do have some time where you truly have nothing to do today, you can just fire up the calendar, pick a task from tomorrow, move it to today, and do it. That way, you are creating slack for your future selves \u0026ndash; they will be tremendously grateful for that!  \r\r\rSide-by-side comparison of a relatively busy but satisfactory week (left), and a not-so-good week (right). Note on the right-side the smaller or non-existent lunch break spaces, parallel tasks/slots (I still thought I could multi-task!), shortening of tasks, all crammed together, and general lack of slack.\n\r\r\rHave you tried to use your calendar as your to-do list? Did it work? Have you tried any other productivity trick recently? Let us know in the comments section below!\n  Of course, I am not the first to come up with this idea in the blogosphere. For example, I enjoyed quite a bit reading David Cain\u0026rsquo;s self-experiments at the Raptitude blog. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n In the last months before the switch, I often added to the calendar \u0026ldquo;meetings with myself\u0026rdquo;, for chunks of time that I wanted to dedicate to do focused work, like writing a paper or preparing courses I was teaching. So, in a sense, this was a sort of \u0026ldquo;transition\u0026rdquo; to the new way of doing things, rather than an abrupt change. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Pro tip: the calendar app now is the home screen when I open my web browser; plus, I can access it easily from my phone as well. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Why do I do this? especially when I am doing focused work, sometimes I don\u0026rsquo;t want to distract myself by opening the computer or the phone, which are full of potential attention-hijackers (think email, WhatsApp, Skype, etc.); plus, I just like the physicality of crossing off a TO-DO/MIT with a pen on the paper \u0026ndash; go figure! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Mullainathan, S., \u0026amp; Shafir, E. (2013). Scarcity: Why having too little means so much. Macmillan. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Of course, it is unclear what is the direction of causality here. Are days with slack better because the slack itself has some beneficial consequences? Or are the busier days where no slack is possible (e.g., deadlines piling up) just going to be bad days nonetheless? \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/calendar-trick/","tags":["Productivity","Calendar","Review","Planning","Scarcity"],"title":"Report from the trenches: of calendar tricks and time scarcity"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"Despite the emphasis I have made so far in developing productive and healthy everyday routines (from to-do lists to pomodoros), not everything about productivity happens at this tactical, day-to-day level. In this short post, I guide you through what I think is the centerpiece of my own personal productivity system: the weekly review.\nIt is raining outside. I can feel the Sunday afternoon blues settling in. What? Another week just went by? Damn! I know I have been doing a lot of things, because I remember distinctly not even having time to go to the bathroom during the day. Many times. But, frankly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know where all that effort and hectic-ness went. Even the weekend was rather full with cleaning up, doing groceries, some sport, the one social gathering that I barely managed to fit in. And tomorrow\u0026hellip; another long list of stuff to do is waiting (and more will come when I open the email).\n(sigh)\nProbably you never have had this kind of Sysiphean train of thought/feeling (i.e., that life is just an infinite sequence of to-dos and tasks). Then, you can just skip the rest of this post. But I do get this \u0026ndash; almost every Sunday. Thankfully, by now I am also able to recognize it as the cue for the most important productivity and personal development trick that does not happen every day: the weekly review.\nThe Weekly Review I already mentioned in a previous post how important it is to take a few minutes every day to revise what you wanted to do that day, plan what you can realistically accomplish the next day, and even write down a short journal entry. That is the daily review. While this short reflection is crucial for your day-to-day sanity, it can also leave you with that sense of endlessness of tasks, which I alluded to before. This is where the weekly review comes in.\nIn a weekly review, you raise above the everyday noise, and plan a bit more strategically, looking not only at the urgent stuff, but also at the more important, long-term stuff that tends to get drowned by the imminent deadlines and the chasing of unexpected fires each day. The origins of this idea, and the way I do it, come from a variety of sources, from productivity systems like Getting Things Done1 and Zen To Done2, to the practices of agile software development teams (which often do a \u0026ldquo;retrospective\u0026rdquo; meeting after finishing a project or major milestone)3.\nHowever, rather than going into a lot of research on why self-reflection is beneficial for our personal learning4 and wellbeing5, I will go directly to the nitty-gritty details of how I do my weekly reviews, in the hope that it will help you kickstart this hugely beneficial routine. Of course, your mileage may vary, feel free to tweak the process to fit your concrete situation, etc. The important thing is that you manage to do it, consistently, every week.\nHow I do my weekly reviews I set aside around 30 minutes6, normally on Sunday evenings, when I know I will do nothing else of importance for the rest of the day. I often put the review as a task in my to-do list and/or calendar, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t just forget to do it. Then, I follow a rather simple but structured process (see also the photos for real examples):\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rExamples of calendar (left) and paper notes/to-dos in a paper notebook (right), from a week that is ending. Some names have been blurred to protect the innocent :)\n\r\r\r Take a look at the week that just ended (see the photos above), by reading your journal entries, to-dos (done and not done), and any other random notes from the week (I have a paper notebook for that, left of the photo)7. I also check my weekly most important tasks (MITs, see step 4 below), to see if I achieved them, and look at my calendar for the week that is coming to an end, to remember important events that happened, or things I did this week that may not be reflected in my notebook (right of the photo)8. Once I\u0026rsquo;ve had a quick overview of what happened this week, I do what the software industry calls a \u0026ldquo;retrospective\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; see the photo below: a short, structured reflection about the period (i.e., the week) that just finished. I normally open a new page in the journal, and write down (important! do not just \u0026ldquo;think\u0026rdquo; answers) a few short responses to the following four questions9:  What went well this week? What important tasks or goals did I achieve? What healthy or productive routines did I manage to stick to? What things that happened I\u0026rsquo;m satisfied with? For a minute, let these soak in and celebrate your achievements! What would I do differently? What didn\u0026rsquo;t go so well this week? which important goals did I miss? Where did my behavior fall short? Rather than bashing yourself as a failure, think in positive terms \u0026ndash; what actions would you change in the future to avoid these problems? What lessons have I learned this week? This is probably the most important of the bunch. From the journal entries, from your successes and failures of the week, are there patterns you are starting to see, of things that are frequently useful, or unproductive, or things you have realized, or interesting things you learned (in your courses, your readings, etc.)? What still puzzles me? As scientists, making questions is a crucial skill. This is your chance to practice it a bit \u0026ndash; in a real-life context. What lessons have you still not learned (but you would like to)? Are there questions floating through your mind frequently, for which you don\u0026rsquo;t have an answer? Are there problems which you often ruminate about, for which you still don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution? Formulate them as questions here (you may want to spend some time later on answering them).   Write \u0026ldquo;3 good things\u0026rdquo; for the week. This is a very simple exercise in which you try to recall three (or more, if you feel inspired) good moments that happened during the week. It can be anything, as long as you enjoyed it somehow. The idea is to bring the episode to your memory, and write down a few short sentences describing it, how you felt and why you think you enjoyed it. I normally do a summarized version of this, in which I describe the episode in 1-2 sentences (enough to remember it vividly), and then abstract from the situation a few keywords about what I was doing, who I was with, how was the environment\u0026hellip; anything you feel might be related with the fact that you liked the experience (you will see why this is useful later on). Plan your next week (see the photo above, right side). I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to fully plan all seven days to the tiniest detail, but rather draw the general strategy for how you want the next week to unfold. Concretely:  I look at my general to-do list and my calendar for the next week (for me both are now the same thing10), and note any important events, meetings or deadlines I select what are the 1-3 Most Important Tasks (MITs) of the week11: what few tasks or projects will have the most impact if accomplished (or worst consequences, if not done)? It can be difficult to choose from our many tasks, but this is very important: if you had to choose between accomplishing two of your tasks because you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough time, which one would it be? One important thing to remember here is to not only put as MITs things that are urgent this week (e.g., a deadline), but also things that are important in the long term, which do not have a strict deadline and hence are often pushed back in time by the urgent but maybe not so important stuff. To this end, it is good to define your long-term goals somewhere (more on that in an upcoming post on \u0026ldquo;quarterly reviews\u0026rdquo;). Once you have selected these MITs, write them down somewhere in big letters, where you can come back to and read every day (I use a new page in my journal, where my notes for the week will start, see the photo above). Also, quite importantly, put in your calendar some \u0026ldquo;appointments with yourself\u0026rdquo; to dedicate the time needed to those MITs, and guard that time as fiercely as you would any other meeting with an important person. Finally, aside from the focus on accomplishing tasks, I also like to set a habit, routine or \u0026ldquo;mantra\u0026rdquo; that I want to focus on for this week. It can be anything, from \u0026ldquo;less, but better\u0026rdquo;, to \u0026ldquo;exercise 30 mins every day\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;keep the journal by my desk when I\u0026rsquo;m working\u0026rdquo;.    \r\r\rHow one of my retrospectives looks like\n\r\r\rBonus tip: cool stuff you can do with your weekly reviews There is another step I normally follow when doing the review. I enter most of the information I generate in the review (the retrospective reflections, the three good things) on a spreadsheet. Of course, it would be more efficient to do the review directly on the spreadsheet in the first place. However, for some reason I find more creativity and satisfaction when I write down the reflections on an actual piece of paper \u0026ndash; and then type them down again in the spreadsheet, to help the ideas sink in. One cool thing that this digital storage lets you do is to have a historic overview of these reviews, your lessons learned, your good things\u0026hellip; and over time, you can see trends emerge. A very simple way I do this is by having some simple visualizations that I run periodically, like the ones below:\n\r\r\rWord clouds generated with the text from my retrospectives. From things that I\u0026#39;d do differently (left), and three good things (right). Some names have been blurred to protect the innocent :)\n\r\r\rI can tell you, when I started doing this, I did not expect conversations, food or walking to be so high on the \u0026ldquo;good things\u0026rdquo; list. But doing the four steps above, week after week, has really helped me learn about what works for me in terms of being productive and happy, and to stay on track towards important, long-term goals. And precisely that is one of the other advantages of doing weekly reviews and having them stored in a centralized place: you have already pre-processed all the important stuff from this week, so that when you want to make those long-term plans, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to rely on your memory or read every one of the (almost a hundred) journal entries and notes for the last quarter \u0026ndash; you just read a dozen of these retrospectives. More on that on a later post!\nOf course, there are the usual caveats: this is just how I do weekly reviews, and multiple other ways of doing the weekly review are available out there. Your mileage may vary. But you can try the process presented here as a starting point, and tune it to your own needs. The important thing is to take a short while every week, take stock of what happened and plan what you want to happen next.\nBack in my own Sunday evening, after I finish my weekly review (and the plan for the Monday that is coming up in just a few hours), I can often feel the relief of knowing what stuff is important in the near future, when am I going to do it, and why (and what I will leave for some other week). The warm feeling of gratefulness for the (\u0026gt;=3) good things that happened recently (which represent good things I have in my life) fills the room. My mind is not racing anymore.\nNow I can take a book and read myself to sleep. Good night!\nDo you also stop each week to plan what the next one will be like? Do you have your own particular process to do it? Please share it with us in the comments section below!\n  Allen, D. (2015). Getting things done: The art of stress-free productivity. Penguin.

You may find you are slower or faster than me, so be sure to check how long it takes you, and adjust how much time you allocate for this. This is a moment when you want to be in a calm and reflective mood, not on a hurry! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n This is another important everyday routine I took from many productivity systems: to have a notebook by my side at almost all times, holding the day\u0026rsquo;s to-dos, and enabling me to capture immediately new tasks that come my way, or jot down any ideas or creative insights I have throughout the day. Super-simple and super-important. I have bad memory. And even if you have good memory, your mind is not designed to hold ideas for long periods of time (i.e., trying to do that has a cost in terms of your available cognitive capacity \u0026ndash; and I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of that to spare!). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I am now trialling the \u0026ldquo;calendar as to-do list\u0026rdquo; trick which I mentioned in the post on to-do list overwhelm, which I update as the day goes on, to reflect what and when I did things (at least, those that took me 30 minutes or more). Thus, by Sunday my calendar also shows how the work week was, and what I spent most time on. Pretty neat if you want to have this kind of quick overview of a week! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Don\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time on polishing the wording of these reflections.

You are not alone. After closing the long series of posts on \u0026ldquo;happiness in the lab\u0026rdquo;, a bit of a lighter read this week. In this post I give very short advice that you can use as a \u0026ldquo;mantra\u0026rdquo; for this and the coming weeks, somewhat related to staying productive \u0026ndash; but with a twist.\nBut first off, a couple of housekeeping notes. I have put up a small post with the links to all the posts of the recent \u0026ldquo;Happiness in the lab\u0026rdquo; series, for easier reference and navigation.\nSimilarly, I have created another index page for the series of posts on writing research papers which I did in the beginnings of the blog. If you have not read them yet and you are writing a paper soon (which should cover about 100% of the PhD student and PhD advisor population), check them out!\nNow, on to this week\u0026rsquo;s post\u0026hellip;\nThis week, as I was hiding further and further down in my tortoise shell (a.k.a. the library) to finish and submit a paper, I also noticed something in my (scarce) conversations with colleagues and PhD students around me.\nEverybody\u0026rsquo;s so busy.\nOf course, it is always like this in research, right? you have to read papers, do your experiments, analyze data, do reports and actual papers, write funding proposals, prepare presentations for conferences, do your courses, or teach your courses, network to find collaborators, and actually do something as a collaboration\u0026hellip; I get it. It\u0026rsquo;s a ton of different things. It was just weird how so many people around me uttered the words \u0026ldquo;doing too many things\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;not really advancing much\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;sorry, I have work to do [talking about the weekend].\u0026rdquo;\nThis got me thinking, is there really a solution to this? What would be good advice here?\nA short piece of long-term productivity advice \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWhat to do when you have too many open fronts?\n\r\r\rThis slogan, attributed to designer Dieter Rams (one of the main designers behind the Braun brand of appliances), was uttered in the context of what good product design should be about: try to do just one thing really well, not fulfilling multiple functions crappily. This kind of design minimalism was then adopted by the likes of Apple (remember when the first iPod came out, with its single function and minimal controls?).\nHowever, I came across this quote recently in a book titled Essentialism1 \u0026ndash; which has nothing to do with design. In the book, Greg McKeown makes the point that, rather than doing a thousand different things to feel busy and important, we should do less things (those that are really important and meaningful), and do them really well. This advice is given as a solution to the problem of frazzlement and fragmented attention which many people seem to suffer in many modern knowledge work professions.\nOne metaphor I like in the book when referring to this problem, is that of the donkey faced with two piles of hay, that cannot decide which one to eat, and finally dies of hunger. Probably many PhD students and academics can relate to the donkey\u0026rsquo;s problems: you start the morning wanting to write the draft for your latest paper, but before that you check your email (in case something urgent popped up); two hours and 63 emails later, you finally get in front of the blank page. After two sentences, you find out that you don\u0026rsquo;t have a reference to back up a claim, so you spend another hour chasing that reference down the Google Scholar rabbit-hole. Then, you remember that you need to finish preparing next week\u0026rsquo;s lectures, and start doing that. A colleague passes by and asks you whether you finished the data analysis for the latest experiment. Oops, not really. You open the email to retrieve the link to the shared folder where the data was stored, but then you see two new special issue calls for papers that look interesting for your most recent rejected manuscript \u0026ndash; better check whether the journals are any good\u0026hellip;\nYou get the idea.\nBy the time you decide to close the day and head home, you have fought in 10 different fronts, didn\u0026rsquo;t have even time to go to the toilet, and achieved absolutely nothing. And that did not even include any family or social obligations, hobbies, unexpected events or emergencies. You could also throw in a bit of checking social media as well, if there were any gaps in your day.\nBut, but, you may cry, a good researcher needs to do all that, these days (even the social media bit) \u0026ndash; and do them well!\nMaybe yes. But doing it like this is just impossible. If somebody told you \u0026ldquo;be creative, but these are the 10 things you need to keep in mind at all times\u0026rdquo;, you would not be able to create anything, or function in any way. As productivity guru David Allen says, \u0026ldquo;your mind is for having ideas, not storing them\u0026rdquo;. And this sort of continuous short-task-switching forces our brains to keep everything in mind, just in case we switch again to it soon (which we perfectly might, given the speed of task change).\nWe tend to see productivity as \u0026ldquo;doing as many things as possible in as little time as possible\u0026rdquo; (so that we can fit more stuff to do later in that span of saved time). What the quote/mantra from Dieter Rams reminds us, is that productivity can also be about the pride of a work well done, the absorption of the lessons learned, the celebration of your achievement, the enjoyment of the process of doing it (which is essential to develop an interest and engagement about what we do).\nBut, but, you cry again, I still have to do all those 10 different things to be a good \u0026ndash;a passable\u0026ndash;researcher! No way I am going to do all that enjoyment stuff about all those 10 things. There is just not enough time. You have to choose: either do many things (crappily) or do one thing well\u0026hellip; right?\nMaybe. Maybe not.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the master solution to this. Nobody has. But there are a couple of things that have helped me do \u0026ldquo;less, but better\u0026rdquo;:\n Longer time-multiplexing: work on the 10 different things\u0026hellip; by the end of the week, or by the end of the month, just not in the same day. The Pomodoro technique in its simplest form (i.e., working on something for 25 minutes, then switching to something else for another 25, etc.) does not cut it for me anymore2. Not for research stuff. In 25 minutes, I barely have enough time to remember where the hell I was last time I stopped working on the problem. These days, if I can, I spend the whole day working on one single thing (or different parts of a same problem, like analyzing data and writing the paper where I explain that analysis). And even this strategy would probably be useless if it were not for #2 below\u0026hellip; End up these long stretches of work with a \u0026ldquo;tangible\u0026rdquo; outcome. Something that synthesizes your advances and new understanding about the problem. Maybe a paragraph summarizing the papers read, or an email to a colleague explaining your advances, or a document with your current ideas for the paper (even if it has more holes than a termite nest). Something you can carry with you, or share with others. Something you can quickly pick up next time to kickstart your thinking about the problem. Something you can reuse in the next task that builds upon this one. Because your research tasks should not be (or feel) disconnected from each other. Everything should be somehow tied to your central questions, you main contributions, etc. (remember the CQOCE diagram?).  Borrowing from a visual metaphor that appears in McKeown\u0026rsquo;s book, you could represent this two-punch combo strategy like this:\n\r\r\rWhat may happen when you do less stuff, but better\n\r\r\rNot a perfect solution, for sure (I still have the impression I do less than is acceptable; and I don\u0026rsquo;t do those few things as well as I think I should). But I have learned to accept that those may be the limits of my productivity. Of productivity that does not feel like crap, at any rate.\nBack to my situation this week, as everything else had to be thrown out of the window in the rush to meet the paper submission deadline, I noticed that my days were, if not more productive (I have the impression that I write slower and slower every year), at least less frazzled and hectic. And the warm, relaxing feeling of achievement in the small unproductive span of time just after the submission, was a welcome change from the constant pull of \u0026ldquo;doing the next short, possibly irrelevant thing\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, you know the drill: write down the mantra in a piece of paper; put it somewhere visible; come back to it every day when you get up, and multiple times during your workday.\nMay you do less, but better, more useful research.\nDid this Monday Mantra help you? Do you have other tricks to help you do \u0026ldquo;less, but better\u0026rdquo;? Let me know in the comments section below!\n  McKeown, G. (2014). Essentialism: The disciplined pursuit of less. Currency. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n And, of course, doing two things at the same time (e.g., listening to a talk and answering emails) is not even a possibility (I end up writing nonsense emails and remembering nothing about the talk). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-3/","tags":["Productivity","Time management","Focus","Mantra"],"title":"Monday mantra #3: When you have too many open fronts"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"In this blog I have often covered the mental health and wellbeing problems that may come with doing a PhD, if we are not careful. In this series of posts I look at the flip side of that, diving into the research on thriving at work, to find out which practices may help us be a little happier during our research, and how to diagnose ourselves about what aspects of our research activity can most be improved.\nThis series of posts is based, to a large extent, on a series of online courses on positive organizational psychology developed by UC Berkeley: \u0026ldquo;The Foundations of Happiness at Work\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Mindfulness and Resilience to Stress at Work\u0026rdquo;. However, I have also extended some of the ideas and tools provided there with my own search of this rich area of the research literature. The series is organized around \u0026ldquo;four pillars\u0026rdquo; or main aspects of cultivating happiness at work (which spell out the acronym PERK). It is thus composed of five posts:\n Happiness in the lab, part 1: What is happiness?, where I look at the non-trivial problem of defining what happiness is and what it is not \u0026ndash; or, at least, what researchers in this area mean when they talk about \u0026ldquo;happiness\u0026rdquo;. Happiness in the lab, part 2: Purpose, reviews the first of four pillars for greater happiness at work \u0026ndash; to find that the (research) work we do is meaningful, both personally and for others. The post tries to help you diagnose the degree to which you feel this sense of purpose about your work, and what simple practices could help you develop it. Happiness in the lab, part 3: Engagement is the second pillar. The post tries to help you diagnose how engaged you feel in your research activities, and goes over several things you can change to make your research work more appealing and delightful. Happiness in the lab, part 4: Resilience, looks at how we can become more impervious to setbacks and rejections, which are bound to appear during the PhD process. The post refers you to research-backed instruments to measure your resilience and daily practices that can help you become \u0026ldquo;grittier\u0026rdquo;. Happiness in the lab, part 5: Kindness looks at the fourth and last pillar \u0026ndash; the importance of prosocial behaviors for a great research workplace atmosphere (from generosity and gratitude, to civility or compassion). Again, I point you to diagnostic tools to evaluate these different aspects of a kind workplace, and several sets of practices and behaviors that may help you and your colleagues improve.  Continuous bliss during your research is impossible (maybe, not even desirable!). Yet, I hope that, with these ideas and a bit of work, you and your colleagues can transform the time you spend in your research workplace into a consistently more supportive experience.\n","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/happiness-in-the-lab-series/","tags":["Wellbeing","Positive Psychology","Happiness","Purpose","Engagement","Resilience","Kindness","Series"],"title":"Happiness in the lab series"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"Writing research papers is one of the most dreaded (and most unavoidable) activities for many people during the PhD. In this series of posts I explore some of the reasons why writing research papers is difficult when one arrives at the PhD, and explain what concrete writing process I find myself following after more than a decade of academic writing.\nThis series, based mostly on my own writing experience and that of those around me, is composed of four parts:\n Baking papers, or why scientific writing is so difficult, where I analyze some of the reasons behind the writing difficulties of many PhD students. Basically, that people don\u0026rsquo;t get nearly as much training on scientific writing as they need; and that training often focuses on the end product (the nice, finished paper), and not on the collaborative and iterative process that leads to that (i.e., the many half-baked drafts that come before the final one). How I write papers, where I go over the initial steps of writing a scientific paper, from initial idea to outline. The post is peppered with real examples of crappy, intermediate steps from a real published paper I co-authored. How I write papers (Part 2), where I go over the second set of steps, from refining the outline to drafting a first version, revising and submitting it (again, with real examples of the same paper). In My Ten Commandments of scientific writing, I acknowledge that writing is often messy, and circumstances force us to step out of the usual process, or take strategic decisions on where to go next with the writing. These 10 guiding principles try to help you navigate such decisions during the writing process.  I wish these tips and tricks are not only useful to survive your writings, but also to transform your writing from dreaded chore into enjoyable act of connection with others (see also this related \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantra\u0026rdquo;).\nUPDATE: Now I have also added a post about what happens when the reviews come back after the submission, and you have to go back to working on the paper.\n How I revise my journal papers: Step-by-step process, principles and examples of how I revise my journal papers when a \u0026ldquo;major revision\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;reject and resubmit\u0026rdquo; arrives.

This week I look at the final missing piece in our search for a happier (research) workplace: the quality of our social interactions with others. Particularly, how positive connections and prosocial behaviors can help us thrive at work (not just survive). In this post, I examine some of the main components of a prosocial workplace, how to assess them for yourself, and a few research-backed practices to make your lab a kinder place.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rImage from https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1452799\n\r\r\rThroughout my professional and academic life, I have worked for extended periods of time in 5-10 different places or teams, depending on how you count. And, throughout these 20 years, I have noticed something: my happiness working at those places seems very correlated with a difficult-to-define \u0026ldquo;sense of social cohesion\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;friendliness\u0026rdquo; of the team working there. This is admittedly a small sample, and there are many cultural factors that could explain why I seem to appreciate such atmosphere (Spanish culture, in which I was born, is rather social and gregarious). But, is it really just me? Have you ever done research happily in a place where this general sense of friendliness and social cohesion was totally absent? (if so, let me know in the comments section below!).\nAs I finish reading and learning about positive organizational psychology to find what might make us happy in our research workplaces, I have come across research that may support the inter-cultural existence of this trend I had observed. Unlike many of the other ideas and practices about purpose, engagement and resilience (which place a lot of importance on you, the individual, and your personal values, feelings and actions), this one is about our interactions with others at work, and the team atmosphere that is generated in the process.\nK is for Kindness Kindness is the fourth pillar in \u0026ldquo;The Foundations of Happiness at Work\u0026rdquo;. A quick visit to the Wikipedia will tell us that it is \u0026ldquo;a behavior marked by ethical characteristics, a pleasant disposition, and concern and consideration for others\u0026rdquo;. However, in the UC Berkeley course they use this word as an umbrella term for a variety of prosocial behaviors, including:\n Generosity. Although in many cultures (especially Western, English-speaking ones) self-defense and competition seem like a more natural attitude when being at work, there is an increasing amount of evidence across cultures that being generous in your work interactions not only breeds a better team atmosphere, but also feels good to the individual (unless the other side treats you badly in return). One can, for instance, refer to Adam Grant\u0026rsquo;s research on \u0026ldquo;givers vs. takers\u0026rdquo;1: Basically, his research found out that it is \u0026ldquo;givers\u0026rdquo; (those people who contribute to others without expecting anything in return) who are more likely to be successful than both \u0026ldquo;takers\u0026rdquo; (those who strive to get as much as possible from others) and \u0026ldquo;matchers\u0026rdquo; (those that try to break even in work transactions). While this can make intuitive sense (we like good people rising to the top, and we\u0026rsquo;d prefer them as bosses), this runs against the popular belief that ruthless back-stabbing is the only way to climb the corporate (or university) ladder. A related prosocial behavior is gratitude (basically, thanking people for what they do for us, big and small). Gratitude has been shown repeatedly to help with job satisfaction and wellbeing2, both in workplaces3 and in research environments (e.g., to improve Ph.D. student-supervisor relationships4). Friendliness. Developing friendships with our co-workers is also a behavior that varies a lot from culture to culture (in some countries like the USA, choosing to go on holidays with your workmates is very rare, while in others like Poland or India it is more common). In any case, there are indications that having such work friendships is related to engagement, job satisfaction and productivity5. Some researchers argue that it is not the friendships themselves that help, but rather things like vulnerability, authenticity, compassion\u0026hellip; which can be cultivated to make the workplace \u0026ldquo;feel friendly\u0026rdquo;, even if real personal friendships are not present. Work friendships can, of course, also backfire when work conflicts arise (as they inevitably do), leading to negative work outcomes5. Civility and respect. When we talk about a civilized behavior, we often refer to politeness or courtesy, but this concept also encompasses behaviors like being open to others, being humble, or interested and engaged with what they say or do. All these are closely related with respecting others and their contributions. Being civil is essential not only in customer-facing jobs like the hospitality industry, but also in any other workplace. In general, feeling respected activates the areas of our brain related to safety (i.e., we feel more \u0026ldquo;at home\u0026rdquo;), and generally increases our happiness6. In turn, being respectful has been shown to improve the image that others have of us, improve our social ties at work, and a long et cetera. An even bigger amount of research has been done on their ugly flip side: incivility. Incivility has been defined as \u0026ldquo;low intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the target\u0026rdquo;7, and it is known to quickly disrupt the atmosphere and productivity of people at work, not only when they experience such incivility by others, but also by merely witnessing it being inflicted upon others, or instigating it themselves8. Detecting a \u0026ldquo;bad apple\u0026rdquo; at work (I think the technical term is an asshole) is relatively easy: you feel deflated, low in energy and self-esteem after talking to them; they normally target lower-rank people, and do it consistently. Stay clear from them\u0026hellip; and don\u0026rsquo;t be one yourself! Empathy and compassion. Empathy is about feeling (emotional empathy) or understanding (cognitive empathy) how other people feel. When you empathize with someone, normally you listen to them, make eye contact, and very often you even mirror their posture or paraphrase what they\u0026rsquo;re saying in your own words. Compassion (sometimes known as active empathy) goes a step further and joins the empathy for others with an impulse to actively help or support the other person. While empathy can have positive and negative sides (especially when we feel others\u0026rsquo; pain but feel incapable of helping), compassion has been linked to many positive outcomes like better health, stronger social interactions, more happiness, lower stress and lower turnover intentions (i.e., intending to quit)9.  Diagnose: Measuring kindness in your research workplace As you can see, there is a lot to unpack there in the last term of the P.E.R.K. acronym. Yet, probably you can think about your everyday research work and start having an intuition of whether you work in a \u0026ldquo;kind\u0026rdquo; place: are people there (including you!) generous with their time or effort? are they friendly (or at least vulnerable and authentic), respectful or compassionate? If you want to have more exhaustive measurements of the different kindness dimensions, you can try the following research-backed instruments:\n To test yourself for generosity, you can take the \u0026ldquo;giver vs. taker\u0026rdquo; test, offered at Adam Grant\u0026rsquo;s website. To explore the extent to which you feel your research environment encourages friendship, you can try the \u0026ldquo;Friendships at work\u0026rdquo; test, based on Carolyn Dickie\u0026rsquo;s research on workplace friendships5. There are multiple questionnaires or scales that you can use to measure civility (or incivility) in your workplace. Some of the most common ones include the Workplace Incivility Scale (WIS)10, based on seminal work on incivility by L.M. Cortina, or the \u0026ldquo;Civility Norms Questionnaire-Brief\u0026rdquo; (CNQ-B, which, as its name implies, is very short)11. If you want to diagnose your lab\u0026rsquo;s culture in terms of compassion, you can take the \u0026ldquo;compassionate organizations\u0026rdquo; quiz, offered by the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley.  Act: Practices for a kind research environment The fact that kindness in the workplace is such a complex topic, also has a bright side: there are many fronts on which you can try to tackle it and make things better. Hopefully, the instruments in the previous section have given you some ideas about what are the areas of kindness that need most working on (for yourself, and in your environment). Here are a few of the simpler practices I have come across for doing precisely that:\n Boost your generosity with simple practices, like:  Doing a \u0026ldquo;five-minute favor\u0026rdquo;: once a week, pick somebody who you have not contacted for a long time, and see if you can help them in small ways. You can also put them in contact with somebody they don\u0026rsquo;t know, with whom they share uncommon commonalities (e.g., they are interested in the same kind of research questions, they are both into Russian expressionist paintings, whatever). You can also help others feel more generous by seeking help more often, in the form of such five-minute favors: asking small, low-effort favors from others that will really help you, and let them know how they helped you (see the gratitude tips below). Starting a reciprocity ring in your lab or department: this is a simple but powerful group event in which every participant makes requests (something they want or need but can\u0026rsquo;t get on their own), and put them on a flipchart or a post-it. Then, everyone helps fulfill them, using their knowledge, resources or social connections (e.g., just writing their name or a tip beside the request). The main idea is to lower the barrier of seeking help, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel so awkward (since everybody has to ask for something). Indeed, the main obstacle to people being more generous often is that we don\u0026rsquo;t know what others need. Also, since you\u0026rsquo;re not making the ask directly to anyone, you don\u0026rsquo;t worry as much about getting rejected12. This kind of events can also help with \u0026ldquo;generosity burnout\u0026rdquo; (in which certain people always help others, but never ask for help \u0026ndash; and eventually burn out). Plus, you will get to know your labmates better! (good for the \u0026ldquo;friendliness\u0026rdquo; side of kindness).   Practice gratitude. A few ways you do it more, and do it better:  Make a point of being better at thanking other people: it starts by training yourself to stop and notice more often when other people do things for you (we are often so busy that we don\u0026rsquo;t even notice, much less thank others). Then, not only say \u0026ldquo;thank you\u0026rdquo;: 1) be specific about what exactly you are thanking them for, 2) acknowledge their effort, and 3) describe how exactly their actions helped you. One gratitude practice that takes place sometimes in our department, is to create (and publicly announce) a sort of gratitude box in which people can anonymously put gratitude notes for specific colleagues. After some set time (e.g., a few days), open the box and deliver the notes to the person they were addressed to. I can say from experience that it feels really warm to receive these anonymous notes acknowledging you for everyday stuff you do which you thought had gone unnoticed. There are plenty of other gratitude practices, ranging from very simple (e.g., keeping a gratitude journal, in which you write down periodically specific things you are grateful for) to quite elaborate (e.g., writing a gratitude letter and delivering it personally to the person you\u0026rsquo;re grateful to). Many of these practices have been shown to boost wellbeing in general, and positive affect (i.e., emotions) in particular13. There are even websites or services to help you setup and keep at doing such \u0026ldquo;gratitude challenges\u0026rdquo;.   Handle conflicts with grace. Sometimes, during your research you inevitably clash with other people, maybe because both of you need access to a limited resource, or you have strong disagreements about the path to take. These can quickly turn into incivil argue-fests, unless we are very careful. You can practice:  Getting better at everyday peacemaking in those conflicting situations: just trying consciously to be polite, bringing levity and humor to the situation, or being modest, can go a long way towards defusing conflicts early on. If it is you who made a mistake or acted unethically, make a point of apologizing effectively: take responsibility for what you did, recognize the harm you\u0026rsquo;ve caused, and express (honestly!) remorse and commitment to not repeat the behavior. If, on the contrary, it is others who wronged you, make an effort to forgive them. You can try using structures like the REACH model for forgiveness: Face the fact that you have been hurt (Recall), visualize the other person, what you would say to them, and then put yourself in their shoes and what you would say in their situation (Empathize); think back to a situation when others forgave you and give your wrongdoer the same gift of forgiveness, unselfishly (Altruistic gift). After doing so, write down a simple note to yourself stating this forgiveness (Commit), and go back and re-read that note whenever you doubt you really forgave them (Hold on to it). Interventions based on these models have been shown to help with depression, anxiety, and hope14.   Improve civility in your lab by using more powerless communication15: acknowledge your weaknesses, listen more (you learn when you listen, not when you speak!), talk more tentatively, or even commit to speak less in meetings16. In your interactions with others, seek advice, not self-promote. Rather than advocate (\u0026ldquo;I need you to do this\u0026rdquo;), inquire, ask questions (\u0026ldquo;what would you do in my situation?\u0026quot;). Improve your workplace\u0026rsquo;s kindness and prosocial behavior through reminders of our common humanity.  This can be done with simple cues in our work spaces: having a common area for informal interactions, with snacks or drinks; putting in your office imagery, art, plants, photos of family, banners with prosocial messages or keywords. You can also do explicit exercises to notice which objects around you in the office are related to social connectedness, or evoke a positive social connection\u0026hellip; and then propose new objects that could be placed in the empty spaces17. You can also rearrange the place\u0026rsquo;s furniture to be more conducive to social interaction.   Work on your compassion, both individually and with others:  Probably one of the simplest and most ancient practices to boost compassion, which you can do on your own, is to try \u0026ldquo;loving-kindness meditation\u0026rdquo; (also called Metta meditation, in the Buddhist tradition). Although there are many variants of this, the basic principle is the same: picturing other people (a loved one, some neutral person, our \u0026ldquo;enemies\u0026rdquo;, or oneself), and repeatedly wishing them well. Yep, that simple (but surprisingly effective to get out of \u0026ldquo;fight or flight\u0026rdquo; mode). You can also try this longer, related \u0026ldquo;compassion meditation\u0026rdquo;. If you know that somebody in your lab is having some problem or going through a rough patch, coordinate with others to do something compassionate for them, to brainstorm potential ways to help this person, and actually doing it together. This will not only help the person in need, it will also create stronger bonds among the group.    Over to you Wow, that was a long post there, but I hope some parts of it were useful (see below for a graphical summary of the main ideas and tools I proposed):\n\r\r\rDeveloping kindness in your research workplace\n\r\r\rAs you can see, there is plenty that can go wrong in our interactions with others when we are in the lab, doing our research: incivility, involuntary mistakes, conflict\u0026hellip; but also there are many ways in which we can make our work places kinder and warmer. Personally, I have always been a bit skeptical of these fluffy, squishy words like compassion or generosity or gratitude. However, the more direct experience I have with these practices (e.g., I have sent gratitude letters within the past few weeks, and I try to do some compassion meditation regularly), the more I appreciate their value. An even greater value lies in not keeping these to yourself, but rather talking about them with your colleagues, and changing some of your behaviors as a group (although this requires trust with your labmates, which can vary a lot from place to place \u0026ndash; I find quite difficult myself!).\nJust try some. At your own pace.\nBaby steps :)\nDo you find that you work in a kind, or unkind research institution or team? Do you find these practices helpful?

Papers get rejected, proposals are not funded, data gets mangled and needs to be collected again\u0026hellip; plus all the non-research-related stumbling blocks that life throws at us, from sickness to accidents or family tragedies. How fast and how well can we recover from those setbacks that throw us off balance? This fourth post in the series goes over the concept of resilience as an important pillar for staying happy and fulfilled while working in research. Read below for instruments you can use to gauge it, and practices to help you stay resilient in the face of difficulties.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rDo I remember the last time something went wrong unexpectedly and overturned my research work? Boy, I can remember ten without even trying hard. That literature review that we had spent months developing and that got rejected by reviewers on grounds that I did not understand (and in a conference, not even a journal!). Or that research funding proposal that our whole team had spent months polishing to perfection, and didn\u0026rsquo;t even make it past the first cut.\nThe academic research world is setup like this: a limited amount of positions, publication venues or funding for projects \u0026ndash; and a fast-growing number of PhD students and research teams, especially in developing countries. As a consequence, such setbacks are becoming more and more common, both for Ph.D. students and any other researcher (ask anyone who usually applies for funding to the European Union). Our next pillar for happiness in your research work has a lot to do with this kind of episodes, and how to survive them\u0026hellip;\n\r\r\rWhat is resilience?\n\r\r\rR is for Resilience So, what is resilience? In UC Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s online course about the topic (\u0026ldquo;Mindfulness and Resilience to Stress at Work\u0026rdquo;), the American Psychological Association\u0026rsquo;s definition is given: \u0026ldquo;the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or even significant sources of stress\u0026rdquo;1.\nMany of us may think of resilience as a personal trait (either you have it, or you don\u0026rsquo;t). We all know somebody that is just able to bounce back, no matter what life throws at them. And it is true that multiple such factors affect resilience: from genetics, to education, early life (or later) traumas, your available economic resources\u0026hellip; all those affect your ability to recover from setbacks. However, psychologists also think about it as a process (i.e., something you can practice), and an outcome of those resilient processes. This includes daily thought and behavior patterns, habits, social situations\u0026hellip; choices we make, which we can change. For instance, having an encouraging attitude towards ourselves, focusing on solving the problems rather than on how bad the problems are, or cultivating social connections that empower us.\nIt is also important to note that resilience is not only about facing the big crises that appear in our lives and our research, but also the smaller stuff that happens every day, \u0026ldquo;handling the stresses of work with grace and equanimity [\u0026hellip;] and ease\u0026rdquo;, as Keltner puts it in the online course \u0026ldquo;The Foundations of Happiness at Work\u0026rdquo;.\nLately, you may have heard also the term \u0026ldquo;grit\u0026rdquo; being used in a similar fashion (popularized by Angela Duckworth\u0026rsquo;s TED talk and book2). Grit is about long-term perseverance and passion for long-term goals (which seems exactly what we need to do a Ph.D.). While it is not very clear how to become \u0026ldquo;grittier\u0026rdquo;, Duckworth herself mentions ideas like developing a growth mindset3: basically, the belief that your intellectual abilities are not fixed, and can be developed (and its corollary: we can get better at solving our problems, so they are not permanent, and can be overcome). Again, we see that developing certain patterns of thought can be useful to be resilient and persevere.\nDiagnose your resilience After the post on purpose, and the one on engagement, I guess by now you know the drill: How do we know whether resilience is one of our strong suits, or it is something we want to work on more intensely? You can try these two short questionnaires to get an initial idea:\n Try out the Resilience at Work Scale, based on the work by Winwood and colleagues4. If you are curious about whether you are a gritty person, you can try the Short Grit Scale (GRIT-S), developed by Duckworth \u0026amp; Quinn5.  One important caveat needs to be made, though: as you may notice, these diagnostic tools are self-report scales (i.e., they ask about what you think of yourself). While this is a reasonable (and easy to gather) measure, it may not measure perfectly how we act when misfortune actually hits us in real life. This is also an important limitation of much of the research on how to train resilience (see below): the effectiveness of the practices and programs is normally measured by such self-report instruments, not by checking how well people recover from actual bad stuff in their lives afterwards.\nAct: Practices for greater resilience in research work How do you become more resilient? is there a \u0026ldquo;magic pill\u0026rdquo; for grit? From my reading of research and resources on the topic, it seems that resilience and grit are a bit more difficult and slow to develop. This makes sense, since resilience and grit are a complex combination of knowledge, attitudes, habits, choices\u0026hellip; many of which are very contextual (we may learn to act resiliently in the training room, but forget all about it when we are in the hospital waiting for the doctor to tell us about our grandma\u0026rsquo;s injury).\nIt seems that there are two main approaches to developing resilience: programs based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and others based on mindfulness training. From a review of randomised controlled trials of such programs6, it seems that those based on mindfulness7 or those that mix both approaches8, tend to have bigger effects, on average. Moreover, these effects stay even months after the program itself ended!\nIf we look at programs and practices for resilience in doctoral students, the research is still in its infancy. We already mentioned last week the use of an 8-week mindfulness program9, which not only seems to improve student anxiety, but also resilience and other aspects of what they call \u0026ldquo;psychological capital\u0026rdquo;. The Arizona State University also has a program called CareerWISE for women researchers in STEM fields, which reports a strong effect on doctoral candidates\u0026rsquo; resilience and overall persistence in the PhD10. However, this is a very comprehensive program with communication skills development, problem solving skills, and many other trainings besides those directly aimed at resilience (their assumption being that working on multiple fronts will help address the many potential causes of women dropping out of STEM PhDs). It makes sense, if you ask me.\nAs we see, resilience training that works seems to require quite a serious effort and specialized training. Yet, is there anything you can try where you are, without going so deep? In the UC Berkeley courses I mentioned above, several easier practices are mentioned:\n One kind of practice that I have seen both in the advice about resilience and grit, is to work on your self-compassion, on a more \u0026ldquo;optimistic self-talk\u0026rdquo;. Self-talk refers to this kind of \u0026ldquo;internal monologue\u0026rdquo; that we often have with ourselves, and which can be harsh especially when bad things happen (\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m such a loser\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so bad at X\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;this thing I produced is still so wrong\u0026rdquo;, etc.). These patterns of thought are internalized during years and years from infancy, and it has been shown that, rather than driving us to success and perfection, they lead more often to low self-esteem, negative perfectionism, procrastination, and rumination. However, such mental patterns can be slowly changed, by re-conditioning ourselves to be more self-compassionate: being mindfully aware of the current struggles we are facing, being kind to ourselves and recognizing them as part of our common humanity\u0026hellip; in short, \u0026ldquo;treating ourselves as we would a good friend\u0026rdquo;. Self-compassion has been linked to better wellbeing, lower stress, anxiety, depression and perfectionism11.  An entry-level practice you can try is to take a \u0026ldquo;self-compassion break\u0026rdquo;: you take a 5-minute break to fully feel a stressful or difficult situation, its effects on you, and then recognizing that such situations are an integral part of life, and wishing well to yourself. Other research-backed practices12 you can try are the self-compassionate letter, or treating yourself like you would a friend. These practices can feel a bit weird at first (e.g., stopping in your lab for 5 minutes with your eyes closed \u0026ndash; tip: you can also try doing it the bathroom, for improved intimacy). Yet, you will probably feel some beneficial effects immediately (let\u0026rsquo;s face it, anything feels better than the full force of our shame and self-deprecating thoughts when something goes awry).   Another interesting mental pattern that you can work on, is to rethink your fear of failure. Before we try something difficult or uncertain, we are often terrified of failure, and try to avoid it at all costs (including just giving up even before starting). However, failures very often are not as bad as we think: indeed, in retrospect we think they are valuable learning experiences! To help you change this unhelpful thought pattern, try these exercises:  Find the benefits of past failures. Pick a past failure. Write down three things you learned from it. Then reflect: have you made any changes to prevent future failures like this? Then, you can take the time now to make some of those changes. You can try variants of this exercise by asking your labmates or advisors about failures of theirs, and what they learned from them. Reframing and visualization. If you have an important, difficult task at hand, try to reframe it as a challenge, not as a threat. Take some time to remind yourself and write down about previous similar challenges that you overcame. Visualize yourself having success at the current challenge (vs. ruminating about what could go wrong). If you feel nervousness, shakiness, tell yourself that you are excited about doing the task, that this energy, this \u0026ldquo;good stress\u0026rdquo; is your body helping you to rise to the challenge (as per Kelly McGonigal\u0026rsquo;s classic TED talk).   Aside from the practices above to change your mental habits, mindfulness practice is probably the most-often cited kind of practice to improve resilience (and many other wellbeing variables13), often in the form of long programs (like the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, MBSR). While you can do such full-length programs (like this free online one), I also reviewed a few simple practices to cultivate mindfulness in my previous post on practices to cultivate engagement. Or you can try a short guided meditation like this one. Give them a go! Finally, one often-overlooked practice that helps boost resilience: take some time off! It is very hard to change your mind habits, be mindful, endure setbacks or stressful situations, when you don\u0026rsquo;t have the mental (or physical) energy. You should be taking time off at multiple levels: some time daily to do something unrelated to your research (be it sports, a creative hobby, or just enjoying time with family and friends); some days every week where you leave your worries behind (the concept of \u0026ldquo;weekend\u0026rdquo;, remember?); and every year, take some holidays. Like, real holidays. We can argue about what is the ideal length (some research suggests 7-10 day stretches work well14,15), but what seems to be certain is that if you don\u0026rsquo;t take holidays, you are more likely to burnout, or just die earlier16.  One important thing to point out about these practices for resilience, is that they often are quite dependent on individual differences6: some may work great for some people, others not so much. This means there is only one way to know what will work out for you: try them out, and track the results (either formally with diagnostic tools like the ones above, or just more free-form journaling of how you feel over time). More posts on this idea coming soon!\n\r\r\rDeveloping resilience to setbacks in your research\n\r\r\rBounce back\u0026hellip; but be careful! Just before wrapping up, a word of warning: sometimes all this talk about resilience and developing it can act as a sort of \u0026ldquo;band-aid approach\u0026rdquo; to curing a serious internal wound. We address the superficial symptoms (e.g., our feeling stressed) without addressing the deeper root causes (e.g., the work culture in my lab is toxic). This danger is common to much of the positive psychology advice and practice out there (which I sometimes draw from), so I will probably talk more about this issue in a later post. So, just to be clear, resilience is not about:\n \u0026hellip; accepting or acquiescing to unreasonable demands, bullying, coercion, exploitation, unfairness, or other people being adversarial, as you do your research work. Sometimes situations or people around you need to change (or you may need to get away from them). \u0026hellip; complacence or helplessness about situations we do have control about. If you think there are things in your hand to change the difficult situation or the adverse outcomes you are facing, act to change the situation, don\u0026rsquo;t just try \u0026ldquo;jedi mind tricks\u0026rdquo; like the ones above. If your experiment failed because you are lacking a certain skill, then get some training, or expert help \u0026ndash; don\u0026rsquo;t just work on your mindfulness chops!  Personally, I am still trying to rebound from the latest funding proposal that got rejected around July: I have taken a real summer break, convinced myself that such episodes are an integral part of a researcher\u0026rsquo;s life, identified things that I can change to do better next time. As I start with some new projects and research ideas (including some new things to try out in this blog), there is some fear of failure, sure. But maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just excitement for doing work that I think is important and meaningful. And, for some reason, life doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel so bleak right now, even as the cold Nordic autumn creeps in.\nWhat about you? do you have tips or tricks to help you bounce back from a rejected paper or bad experiment?

Then you might have some problems engaging with your research work. In this third post of the series on finding more happiness in your research, I look at how engagement at work is defined, how to assess your own levels of engagement, and some research-backed practices to help you engage better with your work and find your \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo;.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rWe have all been there: not wanting to get up in the morning, dreading to open a difficult text we\u0026rsquo;re writing, avoiding our advisor or colleagues because they will bring up the project we don\u0026rsquo;t want to work on\u0026hellip; Unfortunately, this does not go away once you finish the dissertation. One of my moments of lowest engagement was one or two years ago, already a senior researcher, when I realized that I had been overworking long hours for the last few years, but had very little to show for it. Not only then I started dropping balls left and right, saying no to things to keep my work hours reasonable \u0026ndash; I stopped exerting myself altogether. A strange layer cynicism coated my work hours, replacing the drive to do the best that I could. I stopped doing activities I had always cherished, like thinking up a new research study, or reading the latest papers on my field. What was going on?\nE is for Engagement You probably guessed it by now. After purpose, the second pillar of happiness at work (spelling out the acronym P.E.R.K.) is engagement. In the Berkeley course \u0026ldquo;The Foundations of Happiness at Work\u0026rdquo;, Keltner and colleagues define engagement as \u0026ldquo;applying ourselves in a sincere and dedicated way that leaves us feeling fulfilled by our work\u0026rdquo;. Again, a bit of a squishy concept, but probably you can intuit clearly when you feel (or not) like this during your working hours.\nThere seem to be several aspects to engagement at work:\n Attention. The first half of the definition above revolves around our attention as we work, and whether we are able to focus on what we are doing fully, or rather our mind wanders elsewhere. Interestingly, such mind-wandering seems to be associated with lower happiness at work1. In the opposite extreme are the experiences of \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo;2, when we get so engrossed in doing the task at hand that we lose track of time. Emotion. The other side of the definition above has to do with how we feel when we work. More concretely, it is about prioritizing positive emotions while we work, like curiosity, gratitude, enthusiasm, or amusement. And conversely, avoiding negative emotions like regret, shame, hate or conflict. It makes all the sense: why would we engage in a task that often causes us pain and suffering? Instinctively, we would try to avoid such situations. On top of that, it seems that positive emotions \u0026ldquo;broaden our thought-action repertoires\u0026rdquo;3. That is, our mind is able to consider many different courses of action or patterns of thought, vs. the urge to act in a single particular way like the fight or flight instincts (when we think we are in danger). This broader repertoire in turn can help us create better social connections or find creative solutions to the problems we face at work (which probably sets us up for more positive experiences at work in the future). Progress. A third element that is mentioned when talking about engagement at work, is to have a sense of daily progress towards your goals. This might be about feeling achievement for what we do (again, a positive emotion), but it might deserve separate attention, since some studies suggest that progress is the single most important factor that predicts the engagement of people with their work4. We also mentioned this \u0026ldquo;sense of progress\u0026rdquo; as one of the main factors appearing on research about Ph.D. dropouts and persistence (i.e., which doctoral candidates persist in engaging with their research work until completion).  Diagnose: How engaged are you with your research work? Now that we know what we mean by \u0026ldquo;engagement\u0026rdquo;, I suggest you take a few minutes to test yourself and assess how engaged you are with your research work, using the following instruments:\n Try this questionnaire about engagement at work, based upon Rich et al.\u0026rsquo;s research on job performance5. This brief set of questions should give you an overall idea of how engaged you are with your daily research work. Since positive emotions play such an important role in our engagement with work activities, you may also want to do this Job-related Affective Well-being Scale (JAWS), based on the work by Van Katwyk and colleagues6, to see what kind of positive (or negative) emotions appear more often at your workplace.  Do not despair if you don\u0026rsquo;t score very high in these \u0026ndash; but do not ignore it either. I was quite disengaged myself at several points in my career, but there\u0026rsquo;s a few things you can do to progressively engage better with your research work.\nAct: strategies and practices for better engaging with your research It seems kind of counter-intuitive that you can actively do something to feel more engagement about an activity. You either feel it or not, right? Yet, since we know a few of these key components of engagement (attention, positive emotions, progress), we can make engagement more likely to happen, by trying a few simple practices:\n If you think that mind-wandering and lack of focus are the weakest link in your chain of engagement elements, you can choose to work on your attention. Try these out:  One way to avoid mind wandering, at work and elsewhere, is to cultivate your ability to pay attention. A common way to do this, coming from the Buddhist tradition, is to try out mindfulness meditation. The research on applying such techniques with Ph.D. students is still in its infancy (probably I will cover that in a later post), but there is some evidence that mindfulness training can help with anxiety of doctoral students7. There are simple exercises that you can try if you have never done this, like a \u0026ldquo;raisin meditation\u0026rdquo;, mindful breathing or body scan exercises. However, it is quite likely that the effects will be relatively small at first, since this is a skill that takes time to develop. Given the constant pull of our environment towards distraction (did anyone say \u0026lsquo;smartphone\u0026rsquo;?), don\u0026rsquo;t expect quick fixes! If, on the other hand, you want to increase your chances of getting to these (usually enjoyable) \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo; experiences where you get lost in what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, you may have to modify a bit your research work habits and environment. This post by Leo Babauta gives several tips and tricks to increase your chances of that: carving out quiet time when you feel at your peak, finding a task that is challenging, and that you feel is important and meaningful for you (see the last post about purpose), clearing away distractions, \u0026hellip; many of these we already mentioned when talking about the \u0026ldquo;pomodoro technique\u0026rdquo;, but here you also want to practice having this kind of focused attention for progressively longer spans of time.   Following up the elements of engagement, another common piece of advice to increase engagement is to prioritize positive emotions at work. Of course, who does not want more good vibes in the lab? The problem is how: some situations, some people are just shitty and make you feel bad! Well, you can try this:  In the Berkeley course the instructors suggest to try a simple exercise called \u0026ldquo;three funny things at work\u0026rdquo;, which basically asks you to take ten minutes at the end of your workday, every day for a week, to write down the three funniest things that you encountered that day, and why you found it funny. That simple! There is research that shows that this can increase your happiness even six months after having done it for only one week8. Another simple way to look at this issue is just to increase your awareness of patterns and situations in your research work that have some kind of emotional impact. You can take some time to look at the JAWS questionnaire above, and go over each of the emotions mentioned there, writing down when was the last time you experienced each of those emotions in your research work. Very concretely, write down: who was there? what were you doing? where were you? If you then take a look at all the ones that are positive, you may see patterns, people or places that emerge. You may then try to work more in such situations (to the extent that you are free to do so). And the same thing would go for avoiding the patterns and situations that often appear in your negative emotion episodes. A more systematic way of doing a similar thing would be to engage in job crafting: tweaking systematically not only what you do or who you interact with in your research; also changing how you think, how you frame what you do in the lab. Since this practice we also mentioned last week when talking about finding more purpose, I will try to not repeat myself and encourage you to go to last week\u0026rsquo;s post where you can find practices and training materials explaining job crafting in more detail.     You probably guessed by now, the third area of practices to improve engagement has to do with cultivating your sense of progress at work. This is actually a hard nut to crack in the case of Ph.D. students (and researchers in general), since we have many long-duration tasks and projects, e.g., we tend to think of the dissertation (or any research project) as a big, binary task/project (which you have either finished or not), which leads to progress only being perceived once every few years!  Teresa Amabile (who came up with this idea of the \u0026ldquo;progress principle\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the power of small wins\u0026rdquo;, as key to employee engagement)4 provides certain general tips for knowledge workers, like creating more minor milestones in your work, so that you perceive progress more often. For example, you can try to put in your to-do list sections of the paper you have to write (or even paragraphs!). It is also important to celebrate your progress in these milestones (otherwise, the feeling of achievement will be drown out by the urge to get immediately back to work and finish the next thing). Another simple technique to increase your sense of progress is to do a weekly review of what has happened at work at the end of each week, and journal about three good things that happened there (meaning, you made progress on something you value). Personally, I have found weekly (and daily, and quarterly) reviews quite important in my own productivity and sense of progress, so probably I\u0026rsquo;ll do a separate post on that in the future. Another practice that I have experimented a lot with lately, which is related to getting a more frequent sense of progress, is the habit of self-tracking: basically, noting down somewhere (on paper, or on a spreadsheet) some quantitative or qualitative data about your progress, every day. Just like people track steps in their fitness trackers, but for your research work stuff. I have found it quite interesting to understand myself and my patterns of work and happiness, but then again, I am weird ;) As a Ph.D. student or researcher, the actual hard thing is to find what to track: what is it that you do frequently enough to be a useful marker of progress, but at the same time is meaningful enough to give you the sense that you progressed in something important? I\u0026rsquo;m actually thinking to start researching this topic actively (more news to come soon about this)\u0026hellip;    \r\r\rMy current, paper-based, self-tracking device... still a work in progress!\n\r\r\rThat was it for engagement. In case you are more of a graphically-minded person (I know I am), you can also use the graph below to remind yourself about the tools for diagnosis and practices for increased engagement that I have mentioned in this post:\n\r\r\rIncreasing engagement with your research work\n\r\r\rSince that time when my engagement with research reached an all-time low, things have gotten better. I\u0026rsquo;ve started (or re-started) doing many of the things I mention above: I started being systematic in blocking uninterrupted slots of time for focused work, I started prioritizing those research activities that I had found brought me most joy (like writing, data analysis or running workshops), I track my small daily achievements, and I periodically review and reflect on them, I practice mindfulness more regularly\u0026hellip; Still, my engagement is by no means superlative, but throughout those periodic reviews, I can see the slow but steady improvement.\nWhat about you?

Read on to learn to self-assess your sense of purpose at work, and get some ideas on how to make your research work feel more meaningful.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rImage by Wokandapix from Pixabay\n\r\r\rP is for Purpose As it happened with \u0026ldquo;happiness\u0026rdquo; last week, many people will feel that this term is too fluffy and vague to be practically useful. For sure we cannot define (or measure) our sense of purpose as researchers, can we? The course on \u0026ldquo;happiness at work\u0026rdquo; defines purpose as the feeling that you make valuable contributions to others (or to society) that you find personally meaningful, and don\u0026rsquo;t harm anyone. Apparently, there are studies that show that people that work are happier (on average) than people who do not work \u0026ndash; but people that feel purpose at work are even happier!\nThere are several typical avenues to get work to feel meaningful:\n if your work serves a purpose beyond yourself (e.g., I\u0026rsquo;m trying to find a cure for cancer), if it provides opportunities for self-realization (in the form of learning and personal growth, or some other kind of recognition of achievements), if it provides some kind of status and/or the opportunity to acquire and exercise power if it provides social opportunities, such as making you feel you belong to a community, that your ideas are listened to, or that you have freedom to decide what to do and how to do it  Looking at these avenues, one would think that doing a Ph.D. has many elements to feel like meaningful work: you are working to further human knowledge (sometimes even with clear practical applications), acquiring new knowledge and skills, getting recognition (e.g., in the form of publications or citations), being part of a local or international scientific community\u0026hellip; however, this is all very personal. The key issue is whether you perceive these features of your work.\nDo you?\nDiagnose your sense of purpose As a way to self-assess how much you feel this sense of purpose in your work, you can try another couple of research-validated instruments, answering them with your research/dissertation work in mind (i.e., not considering any other job/work you may be performing in parallel):\n The Calling and Vocation Questionnaire (CVQ), based on the work by Dik et al.1 The Work and Meaning Inventory (WAMI) by Steger and colleagues2  How did you do in these questionnaires? If you did not score very high, do not despair. Many, many researchers have worked for their whole lives without a big sense of purpose about their research (maybe their purpose is about other aspects of their lives, like their family or volunteering outside their job). Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why the notion of being happy at work is so foreign to many people. But if this is something you want to change for yourself (and research suggests it can change3), read on for some practices that might help.\nAct: Practices for purpose The course suggests several ways to find more meaning at work, although does not go too much into specifics. After digging a bit more into the literature and other readings, I found a few concrete things you could try out for yourself. However, rather than seeing them as isolated tricks, I\u0026rsquo;d wager they build upon each other:\n Find your values. It is difficult to find meaning in your research if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what things are intrinsically important to you. What are your core values? Don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what to answer (I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what were the possible options!). In the hubbub and busyness of the everyday getting-things-done, this kind of question seldom appears, and we take it for granted. Thus, a good first step would be to take some off time to introspect, to reflect on what are your core personal values. I have found several useful concrete exercises for this (I would try all of them, since each one uncovers different aspects of them)4:  Try out the simple practice of \u0026ldquo;affirming important values\u0026rdquo;. This seems to be especially useful when you ego has taken a hit or we feel evaluated/judged5 (which is quite common during the PhD process!). The Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) investigates how much weight you put to different values that seem to appear across cultures. There is no right or wrong answers. The results of this one I have found enlightening, not only to better understand myself, but also the people around me (conflicts often arise just because we value some things and we take for granted that everyone else shares the same values). Although not so research-based, I have also found this reflection exercise6 to be quite useful to put things into perspective. It takes some more time (maybe an hour), but it is worth the time, especially if you still feel that you don\u0026rsquo;t see a clear meaning or purpose about your life.   Job crafting. Once you know what your core values are, what is meaningful for you, then you just have to find work that aligns with those values. Easy, right? Not really. The research we do, especially during the PhD phase, is seldom fully defined by us, and it is very difficult to make big changes in direction once the research has started. One potential way out of this conundrum in the positive psychology literature is \u0026ldquo;job crafting\u0026rdquo;7. In very simple terms, job crafting is about redesigning your work tasks, your relationships at work, and your thoughts about work. Even if you have limited freedom to do such things (especially as a PhD student), all of us can do small tweaks on what kind of tasks we do more often, who and how we interact with, and how we think about what we do in our research. Try out these resources (in order of increasing complexity):  You can just take a look at the items of the Job Crafting Scale by Tims et al.8, or the Job Crafting Questionnaire by Slemp et al.9, as they ask about concrete behaviors of job crafting. See if you can do any of those in your own research work! This article introduces job crafting in more detail, including exercises and examples. If you want to get really serious about it, there are more detailed training materials, like this one by the University of Michigan, where this concept originated   Remind yourself regularly of the meaning that research work has for you (as discovered in the previous steps). This is one of the job crafting behaviors as well, but it is worth mentioning separately, as it is easy to implement with very little time/effort/cost. Two examples of concrete and easy practices:  Simply, make that core value or mission your \u0026ldquo;monday mantra\u0026rdquo;. Write down your main values or mission (the ones that are relevant and aligned with your research work) in an index card or in a post-it, and keep it with you, in your nightstand, or in a visible place where you work. Just look at it occasionally, especially when your morale falters. If you want to take this practice up a notch, try journaling at the end of the day about how your workday went\u0026hellip; but also reflecting how it aligned (or not) with those important values, and how you could take concrete actions in the future to improve this alignment.    In case you want a visual summary to remember all these tips and tricks, here it goes:\n\r\r\rFinding purpose in your research work\n\r\r\rOver to you Purpose was the first of four \u0026ldquo;pillars\u0026rdquo; of happiness at work. I\u0026rsquo;ll let you in on a secret: when I did many of these tests myself months ago, I did pretty badly (2 out of 5 in the CVQ, for example). In a sense, starting this blog was part of my own job crafting, of finding work that better aligns with my values. And it worked for me. Indeed, I\u0026rsquo;m even considering starting some small research studies related to the topics of this blog as well (which hopefully would align some of my work tasks even more with my values).

However, we all know someone that seems to enjoy greatly their work, even their dissertation work (heck, I have to confess I\u0026rsquo;ve been one such annoying person myself sometimes). What things make people love their work? Apparently, an entire branch of positive psychology has been delving into this question for decades. This post is the first of a series that adapts insights and practices for greater \u0026ldquo;happiness at work\u0026rdquo; from a massive open online course (MOOC), to the work life of doctoral students (and academics more generally).\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rUser:Jathin.d [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\r\r\rBack from holidays! Re-charged or depressed? I am back home after a long summer hiatus that included conferences, working in the peculiar \u0026ldquo;summer mode\u0026rdquo; of many universities (when you don\u0026rsquo;t have to teach, have less meetings and maybe can concentrate more on new or dangling research projects), and some actual holidays away from email and other connectedness. There is a strange feeling of reset. Like a blank slate, the new academic year is full of possibilities, new things to explore\u0026hellip; but also the dread of old commitments, meetings and other stuff I have put off, still waiting to ambush me in the next weeks. This kind of \u0026ldquo;post-holiday blues\u0026rdquo; is, I guess, quite normal as we contrast the relative freedom of schedules and actions during holidays, with the restrictions and routines of our usual work life.\nHowever, these feelings also reminded me of a bigger question I\u0026rsquo;ve often pondered: given the limits to our autonomy that work life represents (and since autonomy seems to be essential for happiness), can we really be as happy and fulfilled at work as we are on holidays?\nIt turns out there is an entire branch of psychology (positive organizational psychology) dedicated to that kind of question. In the last months I have been doing a massive online open course (MOOC) from UC Berkeley called \u0026ldquo;The Foundations of Happiness at Work\u0026rdquo; which introduces you to many basic concepts in this area. While the course seems rather geared towards human resources professionals, it also has some interesting topics for the individual worker (and thus, to doctoral students and supervisors as \u0026ldquo;research workers\u0026rdquo;). To answer the question above, I will try to distill and adapt some of the most actionable insights from this course, in this and the following posts.\nHappiness at work I can already feel some of you raising a skeptical eyebrow when reading the title above in all its fluffiness and squishiness: how can you define, or measure something as subjective and personal as \u0026ldquo;happiness\u0026rdquo;? Psychologists (and philosophers) have been trying, though. A lot. In the course, the instructors make the point that happiness is not about momentary positive emotions, pleasure or hedonism, or being in a perpetual state of cheerfulness. Rather, they provide a working definition taken from S. Lyubomirsky\u0026rsquo;s work, \u0026ldquo;the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.\u0026quot;1 Still fluffy, but probably most of us can agree that these are things we generally want.\nIn the course, they also make the case that workers in this state tend to be more creative and more productive, thus creating benefits for the organization\u0026rsquo;s bottom line. In a similar way, I think the supervisors among us can probably agree that Ph.D. students in this kind of \u0026ldquo;happy state\u0026rdquo; are likely to be more productive as researchers than depressed ones (not to mention the fact that it is more ethical to want people to be happy, rather than the opposite). Nevertheless, in this series of posts I will focus on the individual, personal perspective on how to achieve such happiness at work, not the organizational view of how to create a research lab with this kind of atmosphere (which is also interesting, but maybe for a later post).\nDiagnosing: How happy are you in your (research) work? One interesting thing they do in the course is they give you self-diagnose tools (in the form of research-validated questionnaires), to assess yourself regarding the different ideas and constructs of interest. For example, take a minute or two to do the following questionnaires, answering the questions from the point of view of your research/dissertation work:\n Questionnaire on job satisfaction, based on Cammann et al.\u0026rsquo;s MOAQ2 Questionnaire on overall happiness at work, based on Lybomirsky and Lepper\u0026rsquo;s work3  How did you do? If you scored high, good for you! maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t need many of the tips and practices I\u0026rsquo;ll mention in the next posts (maybe you do them already!). If you scored low, then read on, you may get some useful ideas on how to improve your sense of happiness at work. Back when I did these questionnaires some months ago, I scored around 4.7 out of 7 \u0026ndash; not too bad, but certainly a lot of space for improvement!\nActing: Looking for PERKs in your research work Another interesting feature of the course is that it proposes actions or practices to improve this sense of happiness at work. These actions are gathered around four main areas, four pillars of increased happiness at work, which go by the acronym \u0026ldquo;P.E.R.K.\u0026rdquo; (probably, the pun was intended). The next post will focus on the first of these pillars\u0026hellip;\nCan you guess what the P stands for (as something important to make you happier in your work life)?

This week\u0026rsquo;s short \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantra\u0026rdquo; goes at the heart of such unproductive self-talk. What is all this really about?\nI am finally back from a couple of weeks of scientific conferences and visits to other labs. The physical tiredness of the trip (despite my efforts to pace myself) is more than compensated by the excitement of hearing about interesting new ideas, new methodologies to apply, contacts for future collaboration, and a big pile of references to new research I want to read. However, one also brings back the memory of quite a few unsuccessful attempts at scientific communication (be it boring talks or abstruse papers).\nThis got me thinking about scientific communication. Despite all our good will (no one tries to be boring on purpose), our foibles often trip us up when we try to tell others about our research. We mumble away when asked about our current research, we undercut our findings\u0026rsquo; interest in front of the famous professor or, worse, we try to make slides that are over-complex or full of formulas, to show \u0026ldquo;we can do math\u0026rdquo;.\nI believe that, behind many of these failed attempts at scientific communication, are different insecurities, impostor syndromes and other related flavours of unproductive self-talk. We feel inadequate, judged by our audience, confronted with them like they\u0026rsquo;re the enemy. The best advice I\u0026rsquo;ve heard regarding this kind of situation (from different people and in slightly different forms), is this:\n\u0026ldquo;This is not about you\u0026rdquo; \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rBest advice I\u0026#39;ve heard about scientific communication and science in general\n\r\r\rYes. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\nDespite what your ego might let you think, the presentation, the slides, the pitch\u0026hellip; none of this is about you. It is about the work. The findings. The new knowledge that you found and the evidence that supports your claim. Nobody is there to judge you particularly. They probably don\u0026rsquo;t even know who you are. But they care about these new ideas you present. They are curious, like you. They want to learn.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong: we are all self-referential. We are the protagonist of most of our thoughts because\u0026hellip; well, we are the protagonist of everything that happens around us, it seems. This is all natural. However, when such self-referential patterns of thought (i.e., about me, myself an mine) get out of control, we get into trouble. Self-referential thought patterns and rumination have been repeatedly linked with depression and social anxiety disorder (those feelings of inadequacy in situations where we present ourselves in front of others). Having a lot of comparative thoughts (are we less smart than others? is our work worse than others\u0026rsquo;?) has also been linked with depression1.\nIn general, many of the ugly episodes in the otherwise placid academic life, happen when people make the research be about them personally, not about the knowledge: the battle of egos between two prestigious professors, the \u0026ldquo;asshole supervisor\u0026rdquo; that exploits students for his own benefit, the obsession with publication and citation metrics\u0026hellip;\nConversely, if you look at great scientific communicators, those inspiring researchers that leave you wanting to dedicate the rest of your life to their topic, seem to have an opposite focus:\n They believe (and make you believe) that their topic or research problem is incredibly interesting They focus on how their new findings can be made digestible by others, connected with their experience and knowledge They make clear how the new knowledge (note: not themselves) can be useful for others They make sure you understand to what extent their findings are reliable (or what weaknesses or alternative explanations are there) They provoke audiences to interact with their ideas (rather than trying to crush them with their superior knowledge)  The next time you are present in a very good scientific talk, try to notice whether the speaker makes it about them, or about the work. Chances are it will be the latter. Also, notice how you hear the talk: are you really interested in the speaker? or are you rather there to hear about interesting new findings?\nDo you have some scientific communication tasks to do this week? Try it out. If you read my previous post about the Monday Mantras, you know the drill: take a paper card or post-it, write the mantra on it, put it on your nightstand or somewhere you will see it, carry it around with you, put it very visible, and reflect shortly about it before you prepare your communication work. See if it makes a difference.\nDid you find this short prompt helpful when thinking about your scientific communication tasks?

As a doctoral student, probably even more so. In this post I share a selection of advice and tricks to make your next conference more pleasant (and useful in the long-term). Go forth, and enjoy a few days of \u0026ldquo;geeking out\u0026rdquo; with fellow researchers!\nAs I pack my bags to go to the CSCL conference in Lyon, I find myself wondering if I am prepared enough, and whether I have been doing conferences \u0026ldquo;the right way\u0026rdquo; all these years. To quench my own curiosity, and in the hope of helping if you still find attending to such conferences daunting, I\u0026rsquo;ve read around the academic blogosphere, and added further tips from outside academia and from my own experience1.\nWhy go? Going to conferences is a very common piece of advice for things to do during your PhD. And I fully agree. Going to international, high-quality conferences in your field\u0026hellip;\n \u0026hellip; allows you to get the pulse of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in your area of research: kinds of research contributions, methods, data that are accepted; latest trends; etc. \u0026hellip; helps you to know the people that make up the community. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that putting faces to your references, or hearing how they describe their ideas in talking (formally or informally), helps you get the knowledge that the community is developing. \u0026hellip; enables you to present your work to those people. You get feedback to improve it, are more likely to be cited, and you will probably understand better how your work integrates with the rest of the field (which is essential when writing future papers).  But, once you decide you will go to a particular conference, and maybe got your work accepted for presentation there, what do you do? how do you prepare? how do you behave there? This post gives some tips about that. It is not detailed advice on the whole process of going to a conference for the first time (as others have already written excellent posts and more posts about that).\nTake care of yourself People (especially outsiders) tend to think of an academic conference in some faraway place as a sort of holiday, relaxing on the beach at the taxpayers\u0026rsquo; expense. Nothing further from the truth: after sitting still in uncomfortable chairs for several hours, straining to understand often-unclear presentations (or doing email if you finally desist on that), engaging in deep intellectual discussions over coffee breaks, and preparing your own presentations over the evening/night, you are likely to be quite taxed, physically and mentally. Some tips to keep yourself effective and lively during such days:\n Look at the schedule and plan your rest before the conference starts. Go to bed and get up so that you get the amount of sleep needed to be full of energy during the conference. Take small breaks during the day (NB: doing email does not count!) from the intense intellectual and social activities of the day. For instance, spending some time on your own seems crucial to recharge if you are an introvert (like many of us academics). Pace yourself: it is tempting to try and be in every session that remotely interests you, in every party or extra session, or social event. However, rushing for the whole day is not the most conducive state for a good learning experience: you will not be really paying attention to the current presentation, rather thinking where you have to run next. Rather, set minimums or \u0026ldquo;most important\u0026rdquo; goals for each day of the conference (e.g., go to the presentation by X, which is closest to your topic, and talk to her; have two good conversations, with business cards exchanged; etc.). This is similar to the \u0026ldquo;most important tasks\u0026rdquo; (MITs) approach to productivity, which I have mentioned in previous posts2. And if you find yourself tuning out of presentations, take a short break \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s probably a better use of your time than zombi-ing through presentations for the rest of the day! If you drink at all during conferences (an entirely personal choice, depending on how well you take this well-known social lubricant), handle your alcohol carefully: have lots of avocado before the party/reception, hydrate yourself (e.g., have one glass of water for every alcoholic drink you get), and drink \u0026ldquo;clean drinks\u0026rdquo; (some people recommend NorCal Margaritas), to avoid hangovers and other adverse effects of alcohol-enhanced \u0026ldquo;networking\u0026rdquo;. Which provides a nice segway to\u0026hellip;  Make meaningful connections Networking is arguably the main purpose of any academic conference. However, this kind of social activity can be hard on introverts or socially-awkward people (which abound in academia).\nThe word networking evokes images of slimy, self-centred people shaking hands compulsively and \u0026ldquo;working the room\u0026rdquo; to get something out of attendants. Personally, I prefer to think of what you do at a conference in terms of building meaningful connections with like-minded people over time. One good metaphor for this is your particular scientific community as a neighbourhood: when you arrive to a new neighbourhood, you go up and talk to your neighbours, and try to establish a positive relationship with them. This is not because you need a cup of salt from them right now, but rather because you will cross paths frequently in the future, and having a good relationship with them is likely to have countless benefits in the long term (and it just feels nice). Some tips to start establishing these ties with your academic neighbours:\n Don\u0026rsquo;t just hang out with people from your lab, institution or who you know well. Obvious, as you are trying to make new connections \u0026ndash; but I fall for the safety of familiar people all the time. Don\u0026rsquo;t ditch hard-earned friendships for trying to meet random strangers either. Try to strike a balance. One way to help you with that is\u0026hellip; Putting people in contact with each other (\u0026ldquo;your work reminds me of that of my friend X, let me put you two in contact\u0026rdquo;) helps you combine and expand your existing clique with newcomers. Besides, you are doing them a favour, which they are likely to be grateful for. Make the goal to have good conversations (quality), not meet or exchange cards with N people (quantity). You can also prepare some conversations in advance, by looking at the program and emailing in advance people you think will be at the event, who you would love to talk with. If you are respectful of their time and explain clearly and concisely why such conversation may help you (or both of you), they may be more than happy to chat with you (or at least, be less surprised if you ambush them during a coffee break). Approach people adequately (in unstructured interaction spaces such as food queues or coffee breaks). Do not interrupt two-people conversations, go for slightly larger groups. Who to approach? Take some time to really look at people, and talk to whomever seems more open and relaxed (not to people that look rushed or stressed out). You can also approach session chairs/moderators (rather than speakers), to ask them for recommendations on where to go or who to talk to. They often know well the community but are not as demanded as speakers or keynotes after their talk. Small talk is important to overcome the initial awkwardness of talking with a stranger. Yet, do not just talk about weather: make the small talk work as a first step towards more meaningful connection. Since the other person is also a researcher, there are some failsafe questions and conversation starters: the other person\u0026rsquo;s personal story (\u0026ldquo;where are you from originally, and how/why did you end up in university of X?\u0026quot;), their current work (\u0026ldquo;what are you working on right now?\u0026quot;), or just talking about the papers and presentations (\u0026ldquo;what is the most exciting presentation you\u0026rsquo;ve heard so far?\u0026quot;). You can also \u0026ldquo;geek out\u0026rdquo; about transversal research processes like writing or taking notes on readings (\u0026ldquo;what tool do you use to take your notes and keep them organized?\u0026quot;). Bonus tip: if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand something in an ongoing conversation, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to look ignorant and just ask about that \u0026ndash; academics normally love to explain stuff around their topic.  Don\u0026rsquo;t let all these tips and rules intimidate you, just keep in mind that the other people are human beings, and approach the social moments from a stance of generosity, not greed (as Tim Ferriss puts it, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t be a dick, don\u0026rsquo;t dismiss people, don\u0026rsquo;t rush\u0026rdquo;). Offer to help people out (be it with those headache pills you keep in your purse, or making a connection to someone you know) and you might find yourself unwittingly at the centre of a large social network. Indeed, some of the most compassionate people I know in my community are authentic, albeit involuntary, networking machines!\nListen: getting the pulse of your field Aside from the networking bits, going to talks and keynotes will represent most of your time at a conference. To make the most of those:\n Naturally, you should go to talks that seem to be fully in your same sub-area/topic (that was probably the whole point of going to this conference). However, if you have to choose between two less-related areas, maybe choosing on the basis of the author list/bios, rather than the title, may not be a bad idea (e.g., are there key researchers which you have read or cited?). See also the tips above about getting recommendations from other researchers, to help you decide where to go. Take notes from the talks. This is a very personal thing, but I like to take brief written notes about the talks, as a way of keeping my attention there and avoiding the lure of doing email while half-listening to a talk. I often prefer to do it on paper, in a semi-graphical format (but a plain text file works almost equally well). Also, I like to follow a simple, fixed structure for my talks notes: what\u0026rsquo;s the problem the authors set out to solve, what is the proposed solution, approach or contribution, what kind of evidence they have that it works, and what did I find interesting about the paper (not very different from the NABC research pitch I have written about before). Even if papers do not follow such structure, precisely looking for that information among the wades of slides keeps my brain active enough \u0026ndash; and signals presentation failures (or potential questions) if I fail to fill in such structure.  Present your work Even more stressful than all of the above, is delivering your own talk. How to give a good academic presentation is a thorny topic that has been covered extensively elsewhere (see here and here for some starting points), so I will not go into much detail now. Some very basic tips, though:\n Prepare your presentation in advance (i.e., before you land). This will free your mind to focus on the conference itself and all the exciting things mentioned above, rather than rushedly trying to finish your slides. I have done that a few times myself, and I always regretted it afterwards. Rehearse. For real. Several times, with an audience if you can get some colleagues or friends to hear it. Preferably do this in your lab before the trip, as you will have plenty of feedback from actual researchers, and plenty of time to polish imperfections. Pay special attention to the timing (see next point). Be concise and clear. No one wants the tiny details of your paper written in small print in your slides. Rather, focus on making the main takeaway points of your paper crystal clear. Aim at presenting in 1-2 minutes less than the allotted time (after discounting the time for Q\u0026amp;A). Have \u0026ldquo;optional slides\u0026rdquo; in case unexpected events cut your talk shorter (or you take unexpectedly long to present) \u0026ndash; the opposite very seldom happens. All those missing details are an excellent target for the Q\u0026amp;A round after your talk, and you can keep them in a batch of \u0026ldquo;backup slides\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; but let the audience ask for them explicitly. Aside from your talk slot at the conference, be prepared to pitch your research informally. You will have many opportunities: coffee breaks, buffet lines, that surprise conversation with a famous professor\u0026hellip; I have covered how to structure a brief pitch for your research in a previous post. However, it is useful to have pitches of various lengths available: the one-sentence version, the example of why it is important, or the full three-minute NABC. With those ready, read the face of your interlocutor and select the most appropriate to the context and their apparent level of boredom.  In summary Whoa, that was a lot of advice! Don\u0026rsquo;t try to memorize all of that. Many of these things you will forget to do, but you can try some and see what works for you. Develop your own set of routines over time as you go to more conferences. If nothing else, you can just try to abide by three basic principles:\n Do not \u0026ldquo;network\u0026rdquo;, build meaningful connections with fellow researchers. Think more of how you can help them, rather than getting something you crave out of the interaction. Your work is a gift for the community, not a stick to measure you. When presenting and pitching your work, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid. The knowledge base of your community is like a house under construction. Your work is a uniquely-shaped brick that you have painstakingly baked to contribute to that complex building. The conference is just a great place to show the brick to others, ask around, and try to find out where it fits. No one is judging you (and most of them are thinking about their own bricks anyways). Follow your curiosity and just enjoy these few days of opening your mind to new ideas and perspectives.  The bags are packed, the post is almost finished, so I\u0026rsquo;ll head to the train station and the airport. I can feel now the excitement and expectation of being exposed to new ideas, of meeting some old friends and making new ones. I also remember my nerves as I prepared to go to my first international conference (which, I now realize, was exactly ten years ago, going to the very same CSCL conference in Rhodes!).\nDid you find any of these tricks and practices surprising or useful? Do you have any other tricks you use when going to scientific conferences? Let me know in the comments below. Also, if you happen to be going to the CSCL conference, feel free to drop me a line or just walk up for a chat in one of the coffee breaks, I like to hear from my readers :)\n  I\u0026rsquo;d love to give more scientific, evidence-backed advice, but I have not found any empirical studies on the relative success of different kinds of practices in academic conferences.

This trip is not only a holiday, but also a \u0026ldquo;disconnected break\u0026rdquo;1. So\u0026hellip; you may not see a post here for the next two or three weeks. Sorry!\nThis week, as the academic year nears its end (read, lots of course grading), I did not have too much time to read or write for the blog. Thus, it is the perfect time to try out a new kind of post that I\u0026rsquo;ve been pondering about for several weeks now: the Monday Mantra.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantra\u0026rdquo;? A mantra is a short utterance, word or sentence, believed to have psychological or spiritual powers. They originated in ancient India (using Sanskrit language), and are used in many Asian spiritual traditions like Hinduism or Buddhism and many others. In modern times in the West, you can find a similar concept in short sayings, maxims, slogans, principles or heuristics. The \u0026ldquo;home sweet home\u0026rdquo; signs people hang in their living rooms, or motivational posters people put in their offices, all fall into this broad category. They often are abstract enough to apply and be useful in many different situations, as long as we remember them (which is why people hang them in visible places, as reminders).\nThe Monday Mantra is a simple, practical exercise that builds upon this category of short but useful reminders:\n On a Sunday like today, in the daily review and preparation for your next day (mentioned in a previous post), pick up an index card, big post-it or other pocket-sized piece of paper. Write the mantra on the card, in easily-visible writing. Put the card somewhere, making sure that you will see it when you get up (e.g., in your nightstand). On Monday morning (hence the name), when you get up, take a look at it, and maybe stop for 1-2 mins while you get your bearings. Think how it can be applied today. You can also take the card in your pocket for the whole day, looking at it at random times when you surprise yourself taking it out of your pocket. Or you can put copies of it in different places as reminders, in your office desk or any other place where you work frequently. The point is to be reminded daily of it, to see if its wisdom helps you change your behavior in a positive way. Repeat the previous step also on Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. as you get up and go on with your days. Take 1-2 weeks doing this, until it becomes second nature to apply it. That\u0026rsquo;s it. If you journal (something I also recommend), you can reflect at the end of the day if you applied the mantra, whether it worked, and how did it feel.  These week\u0026rsquo;s Monday Mantra: the best shortest productivity advice As a first example for you to try, I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen this ingenious 11-word pithy advice on productivity, which I first encountered in a well-known productivity website:\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe best shortest productivity advice I ever encountered\n\r\r\rIts simplicity is deceiving \u0026ndash; the hard part is remembering to apply it. This few sentences summarize a lot of productivity advice I\u0026rsquo;ve read from many sources, from productivity systems to time management gurus and other generally busy but successful people. It goes to the heart of many Ph.D. students (and my own) effectiveness problems: procrastination, multi-tasking, dispersion of efforts\u0026hellip; A funny retelling of similar time management principles, in comic strip form, can be found here (kudos to Adolfo for pointing this one out to me).\nI really encourage you give Monday Mantras a try, and see if it makes a difference in your productivity. If you tried it, please please please please let me know how it went in the comments below. In general I\u0026rsquo;d love any feedback on this new, shorter advice/post format and the exercise itself.\n  Not too different from the now-trendy \u0026ldquo;digital detox\u0026rdquo;: a period in which you drop most of your digital consumption and media use. There is still not a lot of scientific evidence on its effects, but there are preliminary studies showing that this kind of disconnection from continuous online exposure (mostly through our phones) may help lower your stress. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/","tags":["Productivity","Mantra"],"title":"A small hiatus, and a Monday Mantra"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"As a Ph.D. student, you very often have to present what your research is about. Maybe you want to get quick feedback from a visiting professor. Or you need to give a talk at a conference or doctoral consortium. In this post, I go over a technique adapted from a large US research lab I once visited. I will walk you through its simple four- (or five-)part structure, including real examples from my own work. Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by its simplicity\u0026hellip; simplicity is actually its main strength!\nAs the summer gets close, many of my Ph.D. students (and I as well) get ready to go to conferences, or workshops, or visit other labs. In all those situations, there will come a moment that I personally dreaded for a long time: when somebody asks you \u0026ldquo;what is your research/paper/thesis about?\u0026rdquo;. Very often, this happens semi-informally, and you may not have slides to support you. Thus, it is more akin to the classic \u0026ldquo;elevator pitch\u0026rdquo;, so common in the business and start-up world.\nSo, how do you do an elevator pitch of your research? How to summarize months, maybe years of work in a few sentences, but still impress, or pique the curiosity of your improvised audience? In the rest of this post, I will share a simple technique I learned years ago, when I failed at doing precisely that.\nAbout 9 years ago, around the middle of my Ph.D., I was doing a three-month research stay at SRI International, a large research institute based in California, which does research on anything from military stuff to education. I was having a nice lunch break with some of the wonderful people I was collaborating with, in the sunny terrace of one of their cafeterias. Then, an older guy comes into our table and asks whether he can sit in with us. Sure enough, we said. I quickly learned that this was Curtis Carlson, then CEO of the institute. A few minutes of conversation later, the moment I was fearing all along, actually happened: he innocently asked me, \u0026ldquo;what is your research collaboration about?\u0026rdquo;. I probably blanked out, and mumbled something about collaborative learning tools we were using with some schools. He patiently listened, and then offered a small piece of advice for situations like this: use the NABC model.\nWhat is the NABC model As described elsewhere, this simple structure originated in SRI, as a way to develop ideas for innovative projects. Its main focus is the value proposition: what is the added value of the idea for the client/customer. The model suggests that every innovative idea has to solve an important client or market need addressed by a unique approach with compelling benefits when compared against the competition or alternatives. One classic example SRI provides, from real life, goes like this:\n \u0026ldquo;I understand that you are hungry (the Need). Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the SRI Cafe (the Approach). It is close, the food is good and it is quiet there so we can continue working (the Benefits). The alternative is McDonald\u0026rsquo;s, which is noisy at lunchtime (the Competition or alternative).\u0026rdquo;\n As you can see, this definition has four elements:\n A Need: Who is the client (the target of the innovation), and what need/problem of theirs are we going to address? how big is that market or collective of people? An Approach to solve that need or problem. What is our compelling solution to that specific client need? You can often use drawings, simulations or mockups, to convey your vision. The main Benefits of using that approach to solve the need. This can be things like lower cost, better performance or quicker response. Very often these benefits need to be quantifiable and substantial. What the Competition has been doing so far, or what are other alternatives the client has (including doing nothing about the need!). Why are our benefits significantly better than these alternatives? Why is this the best value?  Simple, right? Now wait, you say. This all sounds very business-y, and it may be fine for a startup or a big commercial lab. But I am a humble Ph.D. student, and my research is more academic. How does all this apply to me?\nHow N(Q)ABC looks like for your research\u0026hellip; with examples We have already seen that not every research needs to solve an immediate need (especially, in more theoretical fields). Yet, the exercise of trying to distill in a few sentences what your research does and for whom (and why it may be a good idea), is very beneficial. If nothing else, because that is precisely what you will do for most of your research career, when you apply for funding. Plus, it may help you in connecting with other researchers, and see more meaning in your own project (which is crucial for completing your Ph.D.). How would those NABC elements translate to your humble research paper, or your PhD thesis?\n Need: what is the problem that your research tries to solve? If nothing else, a response can be \u0026ldquo;we don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about X\u0026rdquo;. Very often, especially in more applied fields, there is a societal or practical problem behind it. Do you want to cure cancer patients? Will more knowledge about the history of Italian Fascism help modern citizens understand the current rise of authoritarianism? Why is it important to know what you set out to find out? Competition: how have others solved this need so far? This often covers the \u0026ldquo;literature review\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;related work\u0026rdquo; of your research. What did previous research on the problem find out (or fail to do so)? Reduce that body of work to its essence, the gist of what people have done so far in that direction (and what shortcomings those approaches have). Question: Very often, after explaining our topic, experienced researchers will delve deeper with a \u0026ldquo;what is your research question?\u0026rdquo;. Thus, I have directly inserted it here. In most fields, a research question should guide each paper or whole Ph.D. dissertation. And, in a sense, this question is often derived from previous research (see the Competition). Thus, stating the question1 here is a perfect segway into the next parts of the model, which are more about what you do. Approach: This covers both the research methodology you are following (i.e., how you go about answering the question), and what is the solution you found out or propose, to solve the problem. You may mention here any other assumptions or hypotheses you have as well, that were not mentioned in the Question element above. Benefits: In the case of a research paper, this often refers to your results. How did your solution perform, if you evaluated it? did your treatment cure cancer, and in what kind of cases? what is the gist of what you discovered about Fascist history? If your research is still preliminary, you can mention the expected benefits of your proposal. You can also circle back to the Competition, explaining how your results compare with prior research. We are in research, not business, so we can also show a bit of critical thinking and include here one or two main limitations of your approach or our study.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe main elements of a N(Q)ABC pitch\n\r\r\rMaybe a couple of examples will better drive the point home. If you remember the journal paper that I used as an example when describing my writing method, the pitch could look like:\n Need: Teachers very often are asked to reflect about their teaching, to develop as professionals Competition: So far, teacher reflections are infrequent and based on memory (which we know is biased). Sometimes teachers manage to record videos or have observers, but that takes even more time and effort (and thus gets done even more rarely). Question: How can we use technology to help teachers gather data about, and reflect upon, their teaching in an everyday manner? Approach: We worked with a school to iteratively design technologies that let them gather simple data about the issues they care about. The result is Prolearning, a simple anonymous feedback and reflection tool. Benefits: Teachers using the tool in their real classes spent an average of 1-2 minutes per lesson in gathering data. They also mentioned thinking more often about the teaching issues they were asking feedback about. They also said they would not use it literally every day.  And here is another one, for a workshop presentation I will give at a conference this summer. This one is not a finished project, but rather one we are starting (i.e., for which we do not have lots of results yet). Please note the change in order and quality of the model\u0026rsquo;s elements:\n  Need: Collaboration and collaborative learning is a very important skill. Researchers, but also teachers and students themselves need to understand how they work and learn collaboratively.\n  Approach: Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) uses sensors and other sources of data to understand how collaboration happens across digital platforms and the \u0026ldquo;real world\u0026rdquo;.\n  Benefits: MMLA can provide a more complete view of the collaboration process, than teachers just looking at a situation, or analyzing the traces of students using a digital platform.\n  Competition: However, most MMLA is currently done in controlled lab settings, requires complex data gathering setups (e.g., a researcher being there), and its findings are often tied to a particular way of setting up sensors and other classroom elements.\n  Question: Can we come up with more robust MMLA technologies that help us understand collaboration across different classrooms, and which teachers/students can use autonomously?\n  Simple, yet flexible. That is one of its main values. The other great advantage is that it allows for fast iteration of ideas, be it with your supervisors, other co-authors, or any researcher you come across in conferences and other events. Of course, it also requires a small bit of preparation and rehearsal \u0026ndash; you need to memorize your sequence of five elements. But I have found that quite easy, as they often form quite an easy-flowing story.\nOver to you I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but just doing this exercise has helped me bring some clarity to the talk I\u0026rsquo;m preparing for the summer. I can easily build a compelling and memorable presentation around this kernel. Just add a few slides with photos, graphs and a couple of keywords and\u0026hellip; voilà!\nWhat about you? Try this structure in your next conference, or with your latest paper. Pitch it to a colleague or to your supervisors. Ask them for feedback: what parts are unclear or not very compelling? Then, do tell me how it went in the comment section below.\n  \u0026hellip; or a shorter, more direct version of it, since very often research questions tend to end up very convoluted, to accurately qualify what exact piece of the research space you really can explore with your limited efforts and resources as a Ph.D. student. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/pitching-nabc/","tags":["Toolbox","Presenting","Research","Conference","Pitch"],"title":"PhD tool: Pitching your research with the NABC model"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"One would think that research, as the pursuit of new knowledge, is mostly based upon curiosity. However, the daily grind of research life can erode that sense of excitement students have about delving into the unknown. In this post, I explore the role of curiosity in doctoral studies, and look at a few practices and tricks to keep the flame of curiosity alight (without burning the village!).\n\r\r\rCuriosity killed the cat, by beverlyislike\n\r\r\rI have been a bit depressed lately. And for no particular reason: I have a good research job, I\u0026rsquo;m working with a lot of smart people, I\u0026rsquo;m doing my tasks (without getting too overwhelmed by them). Yet, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel nearly as fun as it did in the past. For instance, during my Ph.D., I was sometimes having a blast just reading some random papers! Then it struck me.\nHow long has it been since you learned something new?\nPeople have different motives to get into a Ph.D.. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but I really enjoy learning about stuff. Understanding something that I did not understand. Finding an explanation for odd things that I observe around me (what makes some people a joy to collaborate with, and others a pain?).\nI am not alone in this: curiosity is related with our sense of autonomy as doctoral students (which is considered the most important factor in achieving and sustaining intrinsic motivation and completing the Ph.D.). And one way to support this autonomy is to enable students\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;curiosity-based explorations\u0026rdquo;. But\u0026hellip; is curiosity always good? or is it dangerous, as in\u0026ldquo;curiosity killed the cat\u0026rdquo;? Are there healthy ways to cultivate it during the Ph.D.? Let\u0026rsquo;s get the basics out of the way first.\nWhat is curiosity? In common parlance, we could define curiosity as the strong desire to learn or know something. Curious people \u0026ldquo;ask questions, manipulate interesting objects, read deeply \u0026hellip; and persist on challenging tasks\u0026rdquo;. There are multiple theories and models of curiosity: for example, some researchers have tried to measure it as a personal trait (am I a curious person in general?); others as a state (am I curious now about this?).\nThere is also a kind of ambivalence in terms of whether it is a positive or a negative thing. On the positives, curiosity activates the brain in a way that prepares it for learning and remembering (both about the object of curiosity, and unrelated stuff happening in that moment). It also has other benefits related to exploration: it gives us an increased sense of self, and protects us against the distress we feel when we try new things or step out of our comfort zone. Furthermore, there are many studies linking curiosity and wellbeing: curious people tend to report greater psychological wellbeing, have longer life spans, are more reactive to events that offer opportunities for growth, and perceive greater meaning and purpose in life. Awesome, right?\nUnfortunately, there are also downsides to it: it is known to be a fleeting emotion that very quickly disappears. It is sometimes felt as a negative emotion (e.g., seeking information out of frustration at not knowing). And, most importantly, it can become an addictive behavior, which has been linked with poor impulse control, which in turn is related with all sorts of bad things in life. Thus, it seems that curiosity can be a very nice and useful emotion\u0026hellip; in moderation.\n\r\r\rCuriosity as a remedy with some contraindications\n\r\r\rCuriosity in the Ph.D. Curiosity has always played a role in research and innovation: one can think of the many curiosity-based discoveries (as in, completely useless at the time) that afterwards had a huge impact on science and technology. Innovative organizations are known for leveraging the curiosity of their members. For instance, Google\u0026rsquo;s policy of leaving employees 20% of their time for side projects, or their 70-20-10 rule for how to distribute resources to ensure innovation (10% of resources for \u0026ldquo;blue sky\u0026rdquo; projects unrelated to the company\u0026rsquo;s core business). In areas where we need to generate new knowledge and innovate (like research), curiosity has to be sustained\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip; but also reined! As Inger Mewburn mentions in her online course \u0026ldquo;Surviving the PhD\u0026rdquo;, there is a big dark side to curiosity: information addiction. This is especially common when doing a literature review: the fear of missing out some crucial study, the urge to \u0026ldquo;just find another paper\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; we have all been there, because it is a really satisfying way to procrastinate! And, very often, we don\u0026rsquo;t even take advantage of the papers we find, since we get hooked to the search, not the actual reading. This even has a name: Obsessive Article Collecting (OAC) syndrome.\nIn short, it seems that curiosity in the Ph.D. is a remedy that comes with a lot of caveats. Students should cultivate it, but in moderation. And supervisors probably should keep an eye on this too. Can we find the tricky balance between warning students when we think the current exploration is unlikely to be productive, and blunting curiosity altogether?\nPracticing curiosity I still have not mastered this goldilocks balance of \u0026ldquo;just enough\u0026rdquo; curiosity, neither as a researcher, nor as an advisor of researchers. Yet, there are a few practices that I\u0026rsquo;ve found helpful to develop, sustain and rein curiosity:\n Have a list of curiosities and learning projects. If curiosity is the addiction to acquire new knowledge, it makes sense to separate the impulse (I realize I want to know X) from the response (I go down the Google Scholar rabbit hole for the next few days). People that are addicted to buying stuff sometimes keep a \u0026ldquo;quarantine shopping list\u0026rdquo;: when they get the idea to buy something, they commit themselves to not buy it immediately, and add it to the list. After, say, 3o days, if they still want to buy it, they buy it. However, most of the time the urge to buy recedes, they forget the object or realize they don\u0026rsquo;t really need it. Similarly, I keep a list of \u0026ldquo;things I\u0026rsquo;m curious about\u0026rdquo; and other learning projects that come to my mind. Every time I catch myself thinking \u0026ldquo;oh, I should learn more about [something]\u0026rdquo;, I commit to not follow through (unless it is really central and necessary to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing right now). Only days later, when I have a free time-slot or I want to spice up my intellectual life a little, I go back to the list and have fun learning stuff! As of this writing, my list contains more than 30 such projects, both research-related (e.g., learn more about single-case research designs) and completely random (how do cooperative companies and business models work?).1 Timebox curiosity. Maybe you noticed the word \u0026ldquo;time-slot\u0026rdquo; in the previous paragraph. During work hours, never give in to curiosity without a fixed time limit2. Rather, you can say: I will learn all I can about this during two pomodoros. Or, if you are using your calendar to avoid to-do list overwhelm, you can allocate a free 2-hour slot for it in your calendar, once all the other more important stuff has been allocated. You get the idea. Write down what you learned. Another trick to slow curiosity down without killing it, is to take some time at the end of the \u0026ldquo;curiosity timebox\u0026rdquo; to write down a few take-aways. This is especially useful in literature review frenzies: For each paper you read, jot down something in your reference manager, research journal, or wherever you organize your information. This will help fix what you read in memory, and it may save you from re-reading the paper next time you come back to it. Friday experiments. This practice I learned from my friend (and researcher) Kshitij Sharma, although I don\u0026rsquo;t know if he invented it himself. In brief, it consists on keeping your Fridays free to plan, conduct and analyze experiments or studies that are not at the center of your research. You can think of it as the academic version of Google\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;20% for side projects\u0026rdquo; policy. This works especially well if you do it collaboratively with other people in your lab or department. While this can seem idle inefficiency, it can be tremendously productive. Several of my papers on teacher eye-tracking studies have their origin in one such fun collaboration I did with Kshitij back when we were labmates in Switzerland. (For supervisors) Keep a curiosity-friendly atmosphere in the lab. The practices above are nice, but sometimes our environments do not really encourage such explorations. If a lab/department frowns upon the occasional new method or inter-disciplinary tangent, curiosity and creativity can quickly suffocate. In their advice to encourage intellectual adventurousness in doctoral research, Imperial College London recommends supervisors to create a lab culture that is structured (clear objectives, deadlines, timetables), but also safe to voice ideas; where there are no silly questions, and informal communication happens easily. Take a look at it for more ideas on how to achieve this. (For supervisors) Motivational interviews. Some researchers suggest that curiosity could be used clinically against demotivation (due to curiosity\u0026rsquo;s links with wellbeing). For instance, Kashdan \u0026amp; Silvia suggest the use of motivational interviews, in which a counselor uses empathic listening and the eliciting of self-motivating statements, to prompt people to change their behavior. This technique\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on helping people find their own reasons to do things (vs. imposing what they should be doing) seems like a good match for PhD supervisors trying to help students find their intrinsic motivation \u0026ndash; which is crucial in persisting and completing a Ph.D.3. However, this is a hypothesis, not empirically-backed advice, so take this idea with a pinch of salt!  Back to my own demotivation in recent times, I have to say that I had a blast learning about curiosity, through some \u0026ldquo;timeboxed curiosity\u0026rdquo; (I dedicated no more than four hours over three days to read about this topic). Also, I am starting to think about good ideas for \u0026ldquo;Friday experiments\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\nWhat about you? Are you \u0026ldquo;addicted to finding papers\u0026rdquo;? What curiosity-based practices do you have in your daily life? How do you keep your curiosity under control? Let me know in the comments below.\n  Indeed, this very blog sprung out from one such projects. I had the curiosity to see know more about [the effects of a Ph.D. on wellbeing](ref first post)\u0026hellip; and here we are! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Of course, with your free time, do as you please! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n As anecdotal evidence backing this idea, many of the best supervisors I\u0026rsquo;ve met in my career as a researcher, do seem to be good at empathic listening and asking questions to help you find out your own reasons to do things (vs. telling you what to do right away). This was sometimes very annoying as a Ph.D. student. Now, after the doctorate ended, I appreciate the value such advising style had. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/cultivate-curiosity/","tags":["Research","Wellbeing","Curiosity"],"title":"On cultivating (and reining) curiosity"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"The to-do list is an essential staple of an organized, reliable doctoral student (or academic). Yet, have you ever looked at your task list and felt anxious, certain that you have too much to do and too little time? In this post, I review several routines that have helped me overcome this ubiquitous feeling.\nI have been working (in the industry and in academia) for about twenty years now. Yet, periodically, I look at my to-do list, or at the list of “projects I’m doing”, and I feel my heart rate rise. The grip in my stomach, the slight trembling of the hands. There is no way I’m finishing all that. Not in my whole life.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA typical to-do list of mine. Note the amount of undone tasks!\n\r\r\r\r\r\rMy to-do list around 2017, with the tasks grouped into projects. Note the number of projects!\n\r\r\r\rEverybody gets overwhelmed If you ever had this feeling, it turns out you are not alone. In a recent “productivity in the Ph.D.” workshop that I facilitated, the feeling of having too many tasks was selected the most pressing problem by a majority of the twenty-something doctoral students and academics participating. This pressure on work-life balance is also mentioned in many studies about doctoral anxiety and depression.\nHowever, the research on solutions to this problem seems rather scarce. Most of the advice on doctoral productivity notes that you should have a to-do list. And you should. A to-do list is a very powerful tool to capture tasks and deadlines, so that your head doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to remember. This works very well for many people in all walks of life. But, for many Ph.D. students, there comes a time when the captured tasks become too numerous (especially, if you use digital task management tools, which grow indefinitely). At this point, even choosing what to do next among those 147 items feels like an insurmountable task.\nPart of the problem is that the to-do list has become the place where everything gets thrown: from important mandatory tasks with important consequences if not done (\u0026ldquo;do my taxes\u0026rdquo;) to wishful-thinking side projects that we are not even sure we want to do (\u0026ldquo;read more about theory X\u0026rdquo;). Self-help books and \u0026ldquo;time management gurus\u0026rdquo; give more tactical advice: remove or delegate as much of it as possible; prioritize your tasks; or align them with your top priorities. And, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, that is all good advice, which I have myself followed at one time or another. By all means, read those links and do what they say. In essence, one can summarize such advice in a single idea:\nFocus.\nHowever, most of that advice is something you do once. You organize, prioritize, delegate your big to-do list\u0026hellip; and that takes you maybe a couple of hours. There is no way you can do that very often \u0026ndash; because you don\u0026rsquo;t have time to begin with!\nFinding focus and avoiding overwhelm Here are a few daily practices and routines that have helped me keep the to-do anxiety at bay. Some of them I skimmed from time management advice; others I took from fellow academics. I find they build on top of one another, and are increasingly difficult to pull off consistently. Thus, you could try them out one by one (e.g., adding a new one each week) rather than all at once.\n Level 0: The Daily Review. This is more of an enabler of the other routines, but it is critical. The idea is very simple: take 5-10 minutes every day to reflect on what happened today, review what you accomplished, and plan the next day. It is important to actually write (or type) things down, not just think about it. Check off the tasks you did, and write a few sentences of journaling (what interesting events happened, what was my mood, feelings, or lessons learned1). The Daily Review works best if you do it at the same time every day, maybe as a part of your daily \u0026ldquo;winding down from work\u0026rdquo; routine. For example, I do it as the start of my \u0026ldquo;go to bed\u0026rdquo; process, followed by brushing my teeth, and reading for a while. This offloads my worries and plans to a piece of paper: my brain knows that the important stuff has been taken care of. I rarely have trouble sleeping now, since I started being consistent with this routine. Level 1: Today\u0026rsquo;s To-do. During the Daily Review, after the short reflection on what happened today, take a look into the next day: what appointments you have in your calendar, what errands or urgent things are coming up. Visualize the \u0026ldquo;plan of attack\u0026rdquo; of how are you going to make tomorrow a great day. Then, create a separate, small to-do list with the things that you think you can do tomorrow. Just tomorrow. This list should fit into a post-it, and this is what you should keep in your pocket, in front of you at all times. The other, big to-do list, you will only look at during review time (or when adding new tasks that come up). Level 2: MITs. If you are like me, even the small \u0026ldquo;Today\u0026rsquo;s To-do\u0026rdquo; list is still an over-optimistic chimera, a fantastic expectation I usually fail to fulfill. In my daily reviews, I saw repeatedly 30-60% of the tasks for the day go unfinished. And the harder, long-term important tasks were often the ones left behind. Crucial projects got stuck in my task queue for weeks. Can you smell the aroma of procrastination? Enter the Most Important Tasks (or MITs) of the day2. Ask yourself: among the list of today\u0026rsquo;s tasks, is there 1-3 of them that are vastly more important than the others? something that advances your long-term priorities, even if it is not urgent today? or something that really needs to get done tomorrow, that no one else can do? Then, transform you plain to-do for the day to a simpler list of these 1-3 MITs. Add the appointments (\u0026ldquo;6pm - go to the doctor\u0026rdquo;). The rest, you can put somewhere less visible (like the back of the post-it). Think of them as optional things that you will do once the MITs have been accomplished. Level 3: Ditch the to-do list. Yes, you read correctly. You just stop using a to-do list altogether. But wait, I hear you scream, how do you keep yourself organized, then?? Well, you substitute the to-do list with your calendar or diary3. When a new task comes in, you do not commit to do it unless you find an adequate free time slot for it (i.e., one long enough to do the task). Building up on Level 2 above, you would place first the important stuff (i.e., the MITs)4, the unavoidable appointments and meetings, and only then, everything else (if there is time left). Managing your tasks like this has several benefits, the main one being realism. Time (and not the number of tasks) is the real, limited, non-renewable resource that we all have. This hack puts time in the focus of attention: do I have time to do all the things that I\u0026rsquo;d like? (often the answer is no). Then, I have to accept that I will not do some of those things (at least, tomorrow \u0026ndash; but then, on what day can I place it?). Of course, as the day goes on, your initial plans change, unexpected meetings appear, things take longer than you thought\u0026hellip; all that is normal. Just modify your calendar accordingly, and if you have to move less important tasks to another day, do it. Doing this consistently will make your productivity, triggers and temptations visible, and will act as a vaccine against our personal planning fallacies. You will become a better planner. And the Daily Review is a great time to reflect and do this kind of learning.  Simple advice, difficult to follow Reading this post, you would probably think that I have all this to-do list stuff figured out, right?\nNope.\nI am still struggling with this myself, trying to follow my own advice. For the last months I have been at Level 2 quite consistently \u0026ndash; and I learned that I rarely achieve more than two MITs, so I don\u0026rsquo;t even try. And I\u0026rsquo;m still in the process of making Level 3 work with my own daily routines (see the photos below). I still keep a sort-of \u0026ldquo;big to-do list\u0026rdquo; which I look at in review-time\u0026hellip; but I try to see it rather as \u0026ldquo;things I would like to do for which I don\u0026rsquo;t have a definite time\u0026rdquo;. I know many of those I will probably never do. Eventually, this list will also go away in favor of the zen-master simplicity of Level 3.\n\r\r\rMy implementation of routine levels 1-2-3. Note the MITs, journaling and time to do each task (under the X\u0026#39;s in the left side)\n\r\r\r\r\r\rMy calendar for one day, at review-time. Block duration has been corrected to reflect the real duration, not my plan\n\r\r\r\rWhat about you? Do you also feel this to-do list overwhelm? Have you tried any of these routines? Or do you use different tricks? In both cases, do let me know in the comments below!\n  Especially, you can reflect whether you were able to do all the things that you set out to do (see the other to-do-related routines). Do you always underestimate the time tasks will take (I still do)? What derailed your plans? What were the main distractions and triggers? Can those be avoided? By writing down these things, you learn about how you plan, what makes you productive or unproductive. You will progressively become better at planning and executing what you want to accomplish. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I first came in contact with this idea of MITs in Leo Babauta\u0026rsquo;s Zen to done productivity system. Tim Ferriss mentions a similar principle in his productivity advice. Both are worthy reads on their own right, if you are interested in how different people organize themselves to be productive. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n This hack was pointed out by Paul Rayson, in the productivity workshop I mentioned at the beginning of the post. Thanks, Paul, for the idea! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Pro tip: in my experience, the tasks I do first thing in the morning have more chances to be completed. As the day goes on, the chances that something unexpected will happen (including self-distraction and procrastination) multiply. Plus, I tend to have more mental energy in the mornings. Hence, put your MITs first thing in the morning, if you can! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/to-do-list-overwhelm/","tags":["Productivity","To-do"],"title":"How to deal with to-do list overwhelm"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"This time I would like to turn the mike over to you, PhD students, and let you tell me what you want to hear about in this blog (I will do a separate one for supervisors and supervision later on). What would you like to know about doing a Ph.D., or being a (happier, more productive) PhD student?\nWhen I started this blog back in January, my goal was to learn about how to support PhD students in becoming researchers, especially around certain problems that I had seen with increasing frequency (like anxiety and depression). I also wanted to put out there ideas, tips and tricks that I thought could be useful for others, both from my own experience and everyday practice, and from research studies I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading on these issues.\nAlmost four months and eleven posts later, I hope some of you found some of these ideas useful\u0026hellip; but I cannot help but wonder whether I am focusing on the right topics, on the problems that actually bother you every day as you try to learn the ropes of research.\nNow there seems to be about 200 of us reading this blog (maybe around 50 reading regularly), so let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can make it even more useful to each of you: What are your main obstacles to progress and productivity? What do you see currently as the biggest threats to your wellbeing? what things about this whole research business still puzzle you? what did nobody teach you, that seems crucial now in your everyday researcher life? Let me know in the form below, until May 2nd!\nIf I can give you ideas about how I (or others I know) do any of that, I will. And if there is research on any of those issues, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to find it and bring it on.\nNB: Of course, you can also put your ideas here if you are a supervisor, but try to think them from a student\u0026rsquo;s perspective (what bothered or puzzled you when you were a PhD student?).\nUpdate: Poll results After closing the poll, I counted about one response to the question of what topics the readers of the blog would like to see covered. Thanks a lot, dear suggester! (if you are reading this, you know who you are).\nThis was by itself a quite interesting finding. It made me reflect on how busy everybody is these days (especially in this blog\u0026rsquo;s target demographic), and makes me rethink things like the length and style of the posts: probably people would find them more useful if they were shorter and more direct.\nFinally, in case you\u0026rsquo;re interested, 100% of the suggestions focused on a very interesting topic: how to talk with your supervisor about the issue of (doctoral student) autonomy? We already saw that this sense of being in control of your own direction is quite crucial to persist in the Ph.D.. Then, what to do if you find that your supervisor is micro-managing exactly how the research needs to be done, how the research questions should be worded, etc.?\nBeing now on the other side of the table, I totally understand the supervisor urge to \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; the work or direction of my students (especially when you see they are going in a direction that will prove unproductive, or using methods that will not be acceptable for your scientific community). But sometimes we can go too far and just impose our style of doing things on our students (which is not the goal of a doctorate, in many fields). I am not aware of research particularly around this issue, but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to dig around and I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to you if I find any useful tips or techniques. For now, maybe the only piece of advice I could give is: try to find out if the directions given by the supervisor are really about unacceptable practices, or rather are \u0026ldquo;a matter of taste\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; and try to (politely) point this out, if it is the latter.\n","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/ask-happy-phd-student/","tags":["Ask me","Feedback"],"title":"Ask A Happy Ph.D. - Student edition"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"In last week\u0026rsquo;s post, we established that dropping out of a Ph.D. (or thinking about it) is surprisingly common, and we saw demographic and socio-economic factors that seem related to doctoral attrition. In this post, I dive into another strand of research that relates doctoral dropout with a general theory of human motivation: self-determination theory. This research helps explain why you may persist and finish your doctorate (and even have fun doing it), despite having such socio-economic factors playing against you. Or vice-versa. The post also gleans practical advice from the literature on doctoral attrition, in the hope of helping students and supervisors avoid this common pitfall.\nLast week, I left you with a surprising realization of mine: despite having several of the most common factors of doctoral attrition against me, I finished my Ph.D., and actually enjoyed most of that trip. How come?\nThere is one thing I noticed in many of the studies I mentioned last week: studies asking to students about dropping out often mention the importance of supervision style (or the relationship with the supervisor); and studies asking supervsiors often highlighted whether students are prepared (or, in a sense, \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo;) to face the hardships of a Ph.D. Even if nobody in these studies is directly saying: \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s the other side\u0026rsquo;s fault\u0026rdquo;, it gave a bit the impression of a certain \u0026ldquo;us vs. them\u0026rdquo; mentality, a sort of blame game.\nWhose fault is it, then? students or supervisors? The answer probably is \u0026ldquo;it depends\u0026rdquo;, but I have now come to believe that this is a false dichotomy. The point is not whose fault it is, but rather what elements have to be there for a student to engage in the research work, persist, and eventually finish the Ph.D.\nA way out of the blame game? Self-determination theory As I was reading for last week\u0026rsquo;s post, I found another big group of recent studies, which looked at the problem from a different perspective: self-determination theory (SDT). SDT is a general theory of human motivation that proposes that all human beings have a need to be competent, autonomous and related to others1. The idea is that people feel intrinsically motivated and satisfied when doing an activity that meets these needs \u0026ndash; and feel \u0026ldquo;controlled\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;amotivated\u0026rdquo; when the activity does not. Hence, these studies look at the problem of students dropping out in the sense of how the Ph.D. process and their environments meet (or fail to cater for) these needs \u0026ndash; something that is not the sole responsibility of the student, nor the advisor, but rather the interplay between both2. How does this theory of motivation help explain doctoral dropout and persistence?\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rBasic idea of self-determination theory\n\r\r\rInsights from SDT studies of doctoral dropout It is worth noting that many of these studies had smaller sample sizes, and often were more qualitative, asking about people\u0026rsquo;s feelings and motivations. Thus, they may not be directly generalizable to you or your particular situation. Still, they unearthed several interesting insights and themes:\n Feeling competent and the \u0026ldquo;impostor syndrome\u0026rdquo;. One of the themes that has appeared most often in relation to people dropping out or succeeding in the Ph.D., is how competent students felt (about doing research in general, and the different skills the doctorate entails). It appears under different names: \u0026ldquo;perceived competence\u0026rdquo;3, \u0026ldquo;self-efficacy\u0026rdquo;4\u0026hellip; or their negative flip side, the \u0026ldquo;impostor syndrome\u0026quot;2. Basically, it seems that a lot of student success and persistence hinges on finding ways to shake off this (totally inaccurate) impression that everyone else \u0026ldquo;gets it\u0026rdquo; and knows how to do stuff \u0026ndash; except you. A Ph.D. involves a lot of new skills and knowledge (from writing in a totally different style, to reading information and critically assessing it, being systematic and methodical, being able to abstract and synthesize, or particular technical skills). Thus, if you (and your advisors) manage to find ways of progressively developing those skills, practicing and practicing, first in smaller/easier projects and then increasing difficulty and responsibility, normalizing failure and learning from it, and highlighting and recognizing successes, you will in the end feel that you know how to do stuff (not everything, and not equally well, but much more than at the beginning), and you will believe that you could learn other things if you need it (which is true). When you have this continuous feeling of being \u0026ldquo;competent enough\u0026rdquo;, persisting and finally closing the Ph.D. seems to be much easier. A sense of progress. This theme goes hand in hand with competence as well. What do we use to determine if we are (or we feel) competent? Feedback. A rejected paper, an interested audience when you speak at a conference, looking at the data and finding that your hypothesis was confirmed, or finding that there is some error in the data and you need to repeat the experiment\u0026hellip; all those are forms of feedback that shape our perception of how competent we are, and whether we are reaching our goal of finishing the Ph.D. The problem is, many of the processes involved in a Ph.D. (like preparing and running and experiment, and then analyzing the data and getting some results; writing and publishing a paper; etc.) are very long, and the scarcity of feedback can breed an insidious sense of uncertainty. Am I closer to the Ph.D. now than two months ago? Because, our fears argue, if I\u0026rsquo;m not advancing, I might as well quit and spend my time on something else. The vagueness of criteria for obtaining a Ph.D. does not help either (what counts as a \u0026ldquo;substantial scientific contribution\u0026rdquo;?). Thus, some studies have found that having a feeling of progress, of advancing, is essential to persist in the Ph.D.5. This study also suggests that we tend to evaluate progress on a daily basis (\u0026ldquo;did I do something useful today?\u0026quot;). How to make this progress visible on an everyday basis is a thorny issue for which I have not seen a good, general solution. However, knowing that this is important, you can try to make your progress more tangible in every project or long-term task (see, for example, the paper writing process I propose, which emphasizes more frequent feedback from co-authors and editors than many people normally use). I will dedicate an entire post to dig deeper into this fostering of an everyday sense of progress. Similarly, finding whether students are feeling \u0026ldquo;blocked\u0026rdquo; in their progress for a long time, and seeing if something can be done to help them unblock themselves, seems a worthy goal for doctoral supervisors 6. Not too much distress. This one is quite obvious, but still worth pointing out: no matter how competent you feel, how much self-discipline you have, or how much progress you make, if doing your Ph.D. only brings you negative emotions, if it continuously feels like a burden, that it is full of problems (be them research-related, economic or personal, or psychological)\u0026hellip; it is only a matter of time for you to consider quitting. It basically goes against our sense of autonomy to do something that feels bad, again and again. Some of these studies found that, even if everyone experienced bad episodes at one point or another, doctoral students that completed the Ph.D. had experienced less negative emotions and that those were counter-balanced with positive ones5. Thus, we should not neglect our daily, \u0026ldquo;experiencing self\u0026rdquo;7: if getting up in the morning feels like a drag, if the idea of doing research or meeting your advisors fills you with anxiety, pay attention. Why is that? Talk it over with colleagues, friends, family (because you are not alone8). And conversely, do not ignore the little triumphs, the activities or parts of your day when you feel exhilarated, curious, in \u0026ldquo;the zone\u0026rdquo;. In a later post I will dive into some of this research on how to be non-judgmentally aware of the negative moments, and to emphasize or savour the positive emotions we all have in our everyday research life. Social support. Similar to what we saw when talking about anxiety and depression, it seems that strong social ties may help you complete the Ph.D.. Not only is loneliness linked to doctoral attrition2; this need for social support to endure hard times may also explain the emphasis that many of the studies on attrition make on the quality of the student-advisor relationship. After all, for many Ph.D. students, the supervisor is the only person they interact with in relation to their doctoral research. Hence, if bad times come and no support is given from the main staple of socialization (or worse, if the advisor relationship is actively disruptive), a doctoral project can go south quickly. And this may also be the reason why the presence of additional social support factors, like the positive departmental and scientific community interactions or integration practices, seem protective against doctoral attrition9,10. Probably it is a good idea to seek (and point out to your students, if you are an advisor) these additional situations and people that can provide useful research-related feedback and support: summer schools, doctoral consortia, local Ph.D. support groups\u0026hellip; all can help students realize that their problems are not unique, that difficulties do not mean necessarily that there is something wrong with them or their project. Both students and supervisors should take care of the student-supervisor relationship. Don\u0026rsquo;t let it go sour! A project that makes sense. Having a sense of purpose, being able to work on a project that makes sense to you (versus having no clear research project or being forced to work in a direction that does not make sense to you) also appeared as differential between students that completed or dropped out of the Ph.D.5. This can take many forms: having an idea of \u0026ldquo;where you\u0026rsquo;re going\u0026rdquo; with your doctoral research, and having some sort of plan (even if it is a vague one at the beginning, or it changes later on)11. Again, this goes with the need for autonomy: the project has to make sense to you (no matter how much sense your advisors see in it). If you don\u0026rsquo;t feel a sense of ownership, that this is your project, then it is less likely that you will plough through the hard times to complete it. This \u0026ldquo;making sense\u0026rdquo; can also manifest in whether you associate the research, your project, with feelings of interest, curiosity, and pleasure. Another way to find purpose in your project is if you perceive that it is useful (for you, or for others, or for the advancement of human knowledge). This overall theme has direct applications for supervisors: forcing a student to take a direction without checking whether it \u0026ldquo;makes sense\u0026rdquo; or feels interesting or useful for the student, can have dire consequences. And, from the student perspective, similar advice can be given: if you find that, for a long time, the whole idea and direction of the research do not make sense to you, speak with your supervisor, and with other fellow researchers, about that. I cannot stress the importance of this sense-making enough: it is very, very important, as SDT researchers talk about autonomy as the \u0026ldquo;linchpin of motivation\u0026rdquo;2, meaning: no matter if you get social support and you feel competent \u0026ndash; if your research does not make sense to you, if it does not feel like \u0026ldquo;your baby\u0026rdquo;, engagement with your Ph.D. will likely falter. Ignore this feeling of absurdity at your own peril!  Practical advice from the attrition literature All this research and abstract notions of \u0026ldquo;social support\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;competence\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;progress\u0026rdquo; are very nice but\u0026hellip; does any of these studies actually tell us what exactly we should do (as students, or as advisors)? are there any practices or actions that have been shown to work consistently to help students persist in their Ph.D.?\nIt seems that the research about practices and interventions to avoid doctoral attrition is not as developed as other areas of the problem. The research on SDT and attrition does have some general advice, based on what they call \u0026ldquo;basic needs theory\u0026rdquo; (BNT): basically, the idea that, to be intrinsically motivated and engaged in an activity, the environment should provide certain particular types of support to the three SDT needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness). Thus, based on BNT, some researchers propose12,13:\n To support competence, the environment has to provide some forms of structure: defining clear objectives, providing constructive feedback or advice on technical skills or planning out the students\u0026rsquo; career, and having space for discussions about the difficulties being faced by the student at the moment, and potential solutions. To support relatedness, researchers suggest to foster the advisor (and other actor\u0026rsquo;s) involvement: having a warm, respectful relationship when talking about research, reassuring the student when needed, and being concerned about the student not only as a researcher, but also as an individual human being. Finally, to support autonomy (which, let\u0026rsquo;s remember, was the most important of the three), the environment can help mainly by providing choice and enabling curiosity-based explorations. This includes giving students freedom in how they carry their work (e.g., work schedules or tooling), asking for their opinion about the direction of the research, encouraging them to work independently, or avoiding situations in which students are directed strongly, or under a lot of pressure (including not only psychological pressure, but also economic pressure, or even incentives, as they are known to damage intrinsic motivation sometimes)13.  \r\r\rSupporting doctoral completion with advice from Basic Needs Theory\n\r\r\rAside from such general advice, the research looking at dropouts from the point of view of SDT also includes other ideas for improving attrition rates, although their effectiveness is rather conjectural (i.e., not many are empirically tested). I have seen mentions to practices such as: journaling (as it is known to boost our \u0026ldquo;inner locus of control\u0026rdquo;, which may help with impostor syndrome), some forms of group therapy (e.g., in some universities Ph.D. students have some kind of peer support groups), or even cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)2. Other authors take a different kind of approach and suggest smaller cohorts, tougher or more detailed selection processes or probation periods, to try to get at candidates that have higher chances of completing the Ph.D.\nSo, what will you choose? Coming back to the initially not-so-great chances of completing my Ph.D. when I first started it, does this research based on SDT help explain why I finished the process successfully, and actually enjoyed most of it?14 I think it does.\nAs I mentioned, back when I started the Ph.D., I was single, the career prospects after the Ph.D. were unclear15, my academic credentials were not outstanding, and I had no funding or scholarship to fund my Ph.D. However, the good news was that I had a strong social network of friends and family (who were always supportive of my decision to pursue a Ph.D.), and I had been saving money so that I could support myself during this period. Furthermore, I had the luck to get great supervisors. That alone helped tremendously. Some of the things I think they/we did correctly, in light of what I have now discovered about SDT, include:\n My Ph.D. project\u0026rsquo;s direction was quite open at the beginning, which enabled curiosity-based explorations as I started getting familiar with the literature in my research field. Of course, some hints were given here and there by my advisors, but I did not have the impression of my direction being \u0026ldquo;externally controlled\u0026rdquo;. I was included in an ongoing, relatively small research project in which I collaborated with Ph.D. students from other fields, and in which we had liberty to decide how to do things, a certain degree of responsibility \u0026ndash; but it also was a project stakes in case of failure were relatively low. The aforementioned low-stakes project/collaboration consisted mainly of a long field study in a school (including a lot of classroom observation). This gave me a first-hand experience with the setting and people that my research should be benefitting, and made me aware of problems that my research contribution (still undefined at the beginning) could try to solve. This was invaluable later on to feel that my project \u0026ldquo;made sense\u0026rdquo;, and that it could be useful to somebody. My advisors put a lot of emphasis on planning and making sense of the Ph.D. research direction, through iterative plans for next steps and future studies, and the use of the CQOCE diagram as a kind of \u0026ldquo;compass\u0026rdquo; to understand where I was going. These diagrams and plans (of which I did twenty-odd versions during the Ph.D.), as well as the expectation of having periodic written reports about my advances, helped provide constant proof of my progress during the Ph.D. process. This feeling of progress was also reinforced by having regular meetings with my supervisors (once every two weeks, approximately). In these meetings, supervisors provided hints, ideas, constructive feedback, but never solutions or micro-managing instructions. The relationship with them was always good, and I could clearly feel that both my advisors cared about me not only as a human resource, but also as a person. Halfway through the Ph.D. process, my advisors found a way to fund my doctoral process, by re-aligning my research slightly to also address the needs of an ongoing research project of the lab. This re-adjustment was tricky from an autonomy point of view, but we managed to integrate it conceptually within the ideas and interests I had (i.e., the project still made sense to me).  The list of positive aspects goes on, but you get the idea. I think these factors helped my being intrinsically motivated to do research, to the point that much of the hard work did not feel like a burden \u0026ndash; I was curious, and it \u0026ldquo;made sense\u0026rdquo; (for the most part). Of course, this is all in retrospect: probably back in the day I found several of these (like the lack of detailed descriptions of what I should do) confusing or irritating. In any case, I think I was extremely lucky to count with such advisors, and I recommend you think carefully and review your options before choosing a supervisor (a post on that topic will come later on).\nWhat about you? Do you think your current research environment supports your competence, autonomy and relatedness? You can try the D-N2S questionnaire12 to find out \u0026ndash; and talk with your supervisor and others if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nUpdate: Newer studies in this strand of research point to different kinds of doctoral student \u0026ldquo;motivational profiles\u0026rdquo;, which seem to be related to doctoral completion. You can find out more about these new studies and motivational profiles, in the next post of the series on doctoral dropout.\nGive these ideas a try, and let me know how it goes in the comments section below!\n  Ryan, R.

This post digs into research about doctoral attrition and completion, and what factors seem to make dropping out more likely. Do not give up!\u0026hellip; unless you really want to.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rImage by Siggy Nowak from Pixabay\n\r\r\rAbout 10 years ago, when I left my job in the telecom industry to pursue an academic Ph.D., I started pursuing my other secret dream: being a psychologist. I enrolled in an online masters program on Psychology research. However, several months into the program, it was clear that this was not going to be a piece of cake. I was behind on the readings, some of the concepts in the courses were incomprehensible to me (not surprising, since my background was in Engineering), and I had some unpleasant online interactions with my peers when seeking help about these issues. My morale started to falter, and I started wondering: should I cut my losses and focus on my other main project (the doctoral degree that I had started in parallel)? Or was it better to drop out of the Ph.D. and pursue the shorter, maybe more manageable masters degree?\nDropping out of the PhD: the problem of attrition If you ever faced this kind of thoughts, you are not alone. Not at all. In the research literature about students dropping out of doctoral programs (or \u0026ldquo;attrition\u0026rdquo;, as they call it), very often the ballpark of 40\u0026ndash;60% attrition rate is mentioned1. Imagine you are in a classroom with your peer Ph.D. students. Look to the person on your left. Look to the person on your right. According to the statistics, only one or two of you will ever finish the Ph.D.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow.\nOf course, this is just a general approximation. The numbers vary quite a bit from university to university, and across the different disciplines: in one study, students in science and technology were 50% more likely to complete their Ph.D.\u0026rsquo;s than health sciences ones, and more than twice as likely compared to doctoral students in the humanities and social sciences2. This is probably due to many social, economic and cultural factors that are quite different in each discipline (rather than the inherent difficulty of the subject). Furthermore, even getting to these numbers is quite hard, since very often the researchers running these studies (and the doctoral programs themselves) don\u0026rsquo;t have a good way to know if a student has actually dropped out, or is just unusually quiet.\nThere is also the issue of when will you drop out. Several studies mention that dropping out of a Ph.D. is more probable in the first two years1,2. This is probably due to the students coming to the doctorate with a certain image or expectation of what doing research looks like, and academic research life not living up to those expectations \u0026ndash; leading to disillusionment and dropout. To avoid this, in certain areas like biomedical research, students spend some time at the beginning of the doctorate rotating around different labs to get a better sense of what working in research looks like\u0026hellip; only sometimes this also backfires, when labs start competing fiercely for the best students, so that some labs show a \u0026ldquo;friendly façade\u0026rdquo; during rotation, and a much harsher reality once the student incorporates to the lab for real3.\nSo, it is clear now: if about half of the doctoral students actually drop out of the Ph.D., probably many more have at least considered quitting. Indeed, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that you are quite lucky if you have not thought of abandoning the Ph.D. so far.\nFactors for attrition Now that we know this is a quite common problem, what are the factors related to greater chances of dropping out (or persisting until completion)? Looking into the research on this issue, I found five factors that appear quite often4:\n Kind of funding: Where you get the money from to do your Ph.D. is one of the most studied variables in relation to doctoral students dropping out. While the details vary from country to country and from one discipline to another (which determines what options are available to you), in general having no funding is associated with the highest rates of dropout (between 2.5 and six times more likely to drop out than the other options)2. Scholarships or research assistantships seem associated with lower dropouts5. While details differ across studies, it seems that the more your money source is aligned with your Ph.D., the better (e.g., if you have a scholarship that lets you freely choose your research topic, or your salary comes from a research project fully aligned with that topic). Conversely, if you are doing your Ph.D. part-time (because you took a completely unrelated job to pay your bills, or if you took a part-time lectureship at the university), you might be setting yourself up to have a harder time finishing your doctorate6. Marital status: Interestingly, married doctoral students (or those in a long-term relationship) are much less likely to drop out of a Ph.D.5. For example, in one study in Belgium, researchers found that married students were about four times less likely to drop out than unmarried ones2. As we saw when looking at depression and anxiety, it seems that this kind of close social (and, maybe, economic) support is very helpful to persist in the long journey of the doctorate. Career prospects. Quite logically, if you think that you will easily find a job once you have the doctorate under your belt, you will be more likely to persist until completion5. And vice-versa: once you stop believing that you have good career opportunities after finishing the Ph.D, dropping out seems much more likely1. Relationship with the supervisor. Rivers of ink have been poured trying to explain the influence of supervisors, and their relationship with students, in doctoral attrition. The issue appears in most qualitative accounts of doctoral student dropouts, but so far it has been quite difficult to quantify (e.g., well-advised students also drop out sometimes3). Reviews of this area indicate that a positive student-supervisor relationship is associated with completing the Ph.D.1. But what makes a relationship positive? that\u0026rsquo;s harder to say\u0026hellip; the advisors being \u0026ldquo;available\u0026rdquo;, having frequent interactions, having a sense of cooperation, understanding, and trust. Others also mention a non-hierarchical relationship, with clear expectations, or the advisor not being over-involved in their own research agenda5. Being an advisor myself, I find some of this advice wonderfully vague, but I will dig deeper into the topic of supervision styles, in a later post. Candidate \u0026ldquo;preparedness\u0026rdquo; is another factor that pops-up quite frequently, both in the sense of prior academic achievement (e.g., whether you passed your masters with very high grades), but also in terms of other personal characteristics of the doctoral student. For instance, in one study researchers found that students that passed the masters with very high distinction were two to eight times more likely to complete the Ph.D. than students that had their masters with lower grades2. However, not every review agrees that academic achievement is a critical factor in Ph.D. attrition3. Other reviews also mention students\u0026rsquo; personal characteristics, such as their motivation to do the Ph.D. (if the motivation is high, and is about learning or personal improvement, chances of completion seem to be higher), students\u0026rsquo; time on task, not having negative personal issues, etc.5  OK, so far things seem logical. If we are alone, we are not academic over-achievers, or we have to get an unrelated job to make ends meet, we will generally have a harder time during the dissertation \u0026ndash; and more chances of being faced with the dilemma of abandoning it.\nBut\u0026hellip; what is the right answer?\nA contrarian view of Ph.D. dropout Most of the research I\u0026rsquo;ve seen around this topic describes dropping out as a big problem, a waste of time and resources for everyone involved (students, supervisors, universities, society). And, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I totally see how it is a problem that should not be dismissed lightly. However, I cannot help but think that we are seeing only one side of the coin: that of the institutional success, and the student as a human resource. We could also be a bit more empathetic and look at students as a human beings, and their experience: what if dropping out is the better option for this particular student, as a person, at this point in time? In one paper, a doctoral student explains:\n ‘‘I discussed withdrawing with family and my significant other; they just wanted me to be happy and, given the treatment that I received [from my advisor] for months, it seemed like the clear choice’’3\n The quote reads like a really well thought-out, meditated decision, after enduring a toxic situation \u0026ndash; regardless of the resources \u0026ldquo;wasted\u0026rdquo;.\nPlus, are they really wasted? We may be forgetting that, even if you do not have a paper calling you \u0026ldquo;Ph.D.\u0026rdquo;, it is quite probable that you learned a few useful things during this journey, however incomplete: you learned to read scientific papers, you learned how your kind of research is really made, you learned to write and to argue a bit better, and probably you also practiced your critical thinking (which seems in short supply these days). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call that a total waste.\nSo yes, you should consider carefully before starting a Ph.D. (or accepting to supervise one). But, if the decision was made in good faith, forget about the funding, forget about the time \u0026ldquo;wasted\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; they are sunk costs7. Rather, ask yourself: am I (or is this person) going to be an effective, convinced, purposeful researcher, if I continue my doctoral training under these conditions and in this place? If the answer is no, then maybe quitting isn\u0026rsquo;t a such bad idea. Heck, there is even research that suggests that, if you are at the point where you could decide by tossing a coin, you would be better off making the change right away! 8\nIf you are facing this conundrum, evaluate your environment and your daily experience carefully, and talk about it with family and close friends. But the decision is only yours. Yet, I can give you a general rule of thumb, from what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the academic world so far: if you think you are not \u0026ldquo;smart enough\u0026rdquo;, or you have any other argument for why you will never succeed at this that smells even remotely of impostor syndrome, I\u0026rsquo;d say you can make it (believe me, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some really un-smart people get doctorates). If, on the other hand, your lab environment is toxic, your economic or social situation is really bad, or you feel deeply unhappy every day you do research, maybe it is time for a re-evaluation.\nYou can do it, if you want to endure (or -gasp!- enjoy) the process.\nComing back to my own personal case, I did drop out of the Psychology masters, to focus on my Ph.D. And I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it one bit. Indeed, even after focusing my attention on the Ph.D., a researcher could have told me that my chances were still not terribly optimistic: I was single, I was completely self-funded, my masters grades were not exactly glowing, and I had no idea whether the doctorate would bring me incredible job opportunities.\nOddly enough, not only I managed to finish my Ph.D.; I actually consider that year one of the happiest, most fulfilling of my life.\nAm I an outlier? Maybe yes. Was I extremely lucky? Probably so. However, in some of the latest readings I did for this post, I found an alternative, reasonable explanation. But this post has gotten quite long already.

To finish this mini-series of posts on writing (why writing papers is hard, how I write papers, and the second part of that writing process), I review here the main principles and lessons that I have learned after more than 10 years of writing scientific papers. I hope they help you navigate these decisions if you are in doubt, or if you have to step out of the usual writing process due to unexpected events.\nLet me start with a personal story. A story of failure, and eventual success, after a lot of hard work and harder decisions. The story of a paper I co-wrote, which took more than three years to be published. For a few months, four of us had worked at a literature review, made a conceptual framework out of it, and run some case studies to see if the whole idea made sense to others. We thought there was something there worth communicating to others. We wrote the paper with lots of outlining and feedback, we sent it to a good conference in our field, and back it came\u0026hellip; a rejection. Our paper was not convincing or clear enough, maybe tried to be too many things at the same time. One year into this side project, we seemed to be back to square one. Should we run more studies? should we rewrite the whole thing differently? should we just take it as it was and send it somewhere else? or just forget about it altogether?\nDecisions, decisions, decisions\u0026hellip; we have already established that writing is hard and, even if we have a process to guide us in this endeavor, sometimes we don\u0026rsquo;t have full control: a colleague comes with a full draft that is messy, or we have to re-do the whole paper after a peer review. In those cases, it is good to have general principles, values, heuristics to help us decide what to do. Below, I offer the most valuable lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt after more than 10 years of doing this with moderate success. Half-jokingly, I have put them in the form of Ten Commandments to follow when writing scientific papers1:\n Always think about the audience first. We often think of papers as our accomplishment, something we possess, which we \u0026ldquo;hoard\u0026rdquo; in our CV. However, it really is an act of communication, and the real success is to get somebody to read, understand and be interested in (and eventually cite and build upon) what we found out in our research. Thus, we need to find the right receivers, people like us, who may care about our findings (i.e., choose the target journal/conference carefully). And, of course, we should try to make the paper easy for the reader to get (vs. easy for us to write): provide clear structures, examples, illustrative graphs and photos, cut down unnecessary jargon, etc. Scientific writing is about getting ideas across. Along with the audience, the most important thing in any communication is the message. We should stop worrying what people will think of us by reading the paper (\u0026lsquo;do I write well enough? do I sound smart enough?'). What people will really care about is the new knowledge that we are sharing. Clarity is probably the main value in scientific writing, ambiguity is the enemy, and obscuring or making our text more vague on purpose is the biggest sin. We should be concise and simple, if things can be communicated effectively in that way: people are busy and they will appreciate getting the main point of our research in three pages rather than 30 (see the 1st Commandment). Go from core ideas to actual text (top-down approach). This may be just a personal pet peeve of mine, but I think this principle is crucial to have a sensible structure, logical coherence\u0026hellip; in short, to achieve the clarity of message required by the 2nd Commandment. We should always go through outlines and bullet-point ideas before writing a single line of draft text. If you personally prefer to start writing text directly, that\u0026rsquo;s fine\u0026hellip; but then reverse-outline your text and work on the outline: find logical gaps, repetitions of the same arguments, etc. (and be ready to throw away lots of that draft, in compliance with the 1st and 2nd Commandments). You never get it right the first time. I have never, ever, written (or seen) a first draft of a scientific paper that is published as-is in a good peer-reviewed journal. We should forget about that notion altogether. We will make mistakes, we will fail to see ambiguities, or people will misinterpret our words. And that\u0026rsquo;s OK. Breakdowns and repairs are an essential part of any communication. We need to \u0026ldquo;normalize failure\u0026rdquo; when writing, fail early and fail often, learning from our mistakes until we find the right way of communicating our ideas. That\u0026rsquo;s why I see writing as an iterative process, very much like designing any other object. We need to think of each abstract, each outline, each draft, as a prototype of the communication act we\u0026rsquo;re attempting. And, eventually, build the paper that synthesizes all that we learned about communicating those ideas. But, how can we see the faults in our own prototypes, the creations we have crafted as best as we could? Read on\u0026hellip; Feedback (from co-authors, from the scientific community) is essential to good quality writing. Every time I write a paper alone, I find that the quality of the ideas and the end result are just passable; however, once I mix other people in the process, they start seeing logical gaps, unnoticed connections to other ideas or extant research, and in the end the result is so much better. The same goes for the peer review process: even if I don\u0026rsquo;t always agree with them, reviewers\u0026rsquo; different perspectives (or misinterpretations, even) make me realize that the text was not as unambiguous as I originally thought. Of course, this is not magic: we need to choose co-authors wisely (and choose journals/conferences where we know the review process is tough but high-quality), learn from our mistakes and our good choices. And if we think of writing as something we are always learning to do better (and we should, even after we become the respected Professor), feedback is a well-known, necessary component2. There is no mastery without feedback3! Release early, release often (or \u0026ldquo;showing incomplete work is OK\u0026rdquo;). This is just an attempt to hammer down the 3rd, 4th and 5th Commandments again, by taking a well-known motto from the software development industry. If we want lots of feedback, and we wait until we have a complete paper before showing our ideas to others, it\u0026rsquo;s going to take forever to do even 2-3 rounds of feedback (if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky enough to get such patient co-authors). The only alternative if we want four, five or more rounds of feedback, is to show incomplete work. There is no way around it. We should forget our perfectionism and what our advisors/co-authors will think. Sending them an outline today is better than sending a draft next month. Besides, co-authors tend to be busy people \u0026ndash; it may be easier for them to find half an hour to read our outline this week, rather than a whole morning to read a complete draft anytime next month. Communicate effectively. As with any other collaboration, communicating clearly, politely, and respectfully goes a long way. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take people for granted, everyone in the pipeline (from our co-authors to the editors, or the reviewers) is doing this work of helping improve and publish our paper on a voluntary basis, for free (or for quite cheap). Saying \u0026ldquo;thank you\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;please\u0026rdquo;, laying out expectations clearly, meeting deadlines, being open to negotiate, etc. are more important than most people realize. Also, let\u0026rsquo;s remember that most actors in this business are more experienced than we are, and that they may have a point (even if we sometimes disagree). Learn to use a few tools to make your life easier. If writing is a craft, we need to learn the craft\u0026rsquo;s tools. Not all the tools out there, but at least the ones that we will need very often. Reference managers (lately I use Zotero), collaborative editors like Google Docs (or Overleaf if submitting to journals that use Latex), the sometimes-hated-but-ubiquitous Microsoft Word, submission systems, diagram drawing apps (e.g., Google Draw), Excel, R or whatever software we use for generating graphs\u0026hellip; all are part of the writing process at some point. We should learn to use each of those, and how they interact (can my graphing app export graphs that the submission system accepts?). There\u0026rsquo;s no need to spend too much time fiddling with them or trying new ones. But, if we find that our current toolbox gets in the way, let\u0026rsquo;s go out and find another tool that makes things easier in this and future occasions. Ask around; probably others have faced the same problem we now have. You only learn about writing by writing. Despite the emphasis on outlines, feedback and other tricks to make the writing process efficient, in the end we have to write, and write well, write clearly. And practicing a lot seems to be necessary (but not sufficient3) to be good at anything. So we should write, write, write any time we can. Write for ourselves. Love writing. Have a \u0026ldquo;craftsman mindset\u0026rdquo; about our writing4. If we find some good writing courses (scientific or otherwise), by all means we should try that too. Being skillful at clear writing is the single biggest academic and professional booster I\u0026rsquo;ve found in my life (and I\u0026rsquo;m not alone in thinking that). … (insert your own)\u0026hellip; In the end, writing is also a creative activity, and in that sense it is very personal. There is no single best way to do it that works for everyone. Once we comply with the nine Commandments above, what else is important? Find your own principles, your values, your voice, your process. And put the main idea here (or make an 11th, 12th Commandments \u0026ndash; who says they have to be 10?).  Just for the fun of it, I also tried to summarize the Ten Commandments above into two Great Principles of writing. I came up with this:\n  Writing is not about you, it is about how you can help others with the new knowledge you discovered, and\n  Papers are designed communication artifacts: prototype, iterate and collaborate around them!\n  I recommend you have these Commandments, these principles present every time you start writing something scientific. You could even print them out and put them somewhere visible, in the place where you do your writing:\n\r\r\rMy Ten Commandments of writing\n\r\r\rBack to the initial story of our failed paper, these principles helped us navigate the decisions during the following two years. It was obvious that our proposal was not clear enough (2nd Commandment) and a change of approach was needed. We re-did the paper entirely (4th), going from a clearer main idea for the contribution into a totally different outline (3rd). However, we still were not convinced that the new orientation was strong and clear enough. Hence, we enlisted the help of a new, fifth co-author, a very well-respected researcher in the scientific community we had as the target (1st). We sought feedback from him (5th, 7th), even before we wrote a single word of actual draft text (6th). He saw the potential of the idea, but pointed out a few flaws in our approach. We addressed those, and started writing and writing (9th). Several rounds of feedback ensued among ourselves (5th again) until we all were satisfied with the text. Of course, throughout this complex process we had to share documents, keep our references under control (especially since it was a literature review), keep track and be able to reproduce our diagrams, tables, and other artifacts (8th). We found a new target venue for our paper by politely contacting the editors (7th) of a journal which was quite interested in the field we were targeting (1st), and sent it there. Of course, revisions came from the journal (5th), and more writing had to be done (9th) to clarify, and polish, and make sure that the audience (1st) would get the message (2nd). But eventually, the paper was accepted!\nSo, get off the couch and start writing! Heed the 9th Commandment. May you have lots of success with your future papers, and let these principles guide you to a place where writing papers is actually fun. I know that place exists \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m having a drink there right now.\nDo you agree with my nine Commandments of writing? What would you pose as your \u0026ldquo;10th commandment\u0026rdquo;? Let me know in the comments below!\n  Of course, you will notice many similarities between these principles and the 10-step paper writing process I outlined in previous posts. It is these principles that shaped that process! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hattie, J. (2008). Visible learning: A synthesis of over 800 meta-analyses relating to achievement.

In a previous post, I started describing in detail the process I normally follow to write my scientific papers. This post explains the rest of the process, from the outlining until you send your manuscript off to the journal/conference. One would think that this is straightforward, just scribbling and scribbling, right?\nFor those of you that did not read the previous post, I strongly recommend you go read it before reading the rest of this one. For you, and for the rest of us who just have bad memory, here is what the overall process looked like, including not only what to do in each step, but also when to get feedback from others:\n\r\r\rMy paper writing process\n\r\r\rIn steps 1\u0026ndash;5, we came up with a central idea for our paper (i.e., the contribution, the reusable knowledge that we think other researchers will be interested in). Then, we decided who our audience is (i.e., what specific community, what journal/conference would be interested), and who would be a good set of co-authors to write it with. Afterwards, we created a pseudo-abstract that summarized what is known about the paper\u0026rsquo;s topic, and what the paper brings to the scientific community and society at large. Finally, we created a \u0026ldquo;weighted outline\u0026rdquo; (a table of contents with assigned lengths for each section). You also got feedback from your co-authors a couple of times along the way, and maybe you even got the editor of the journal to signal if the paper idea would be appropriate for the journal. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s move on\u0026hellip;\nStep 6. A second, detailed outline This is just the classic, run-of-the-mill, outlining technique that many of us have been taught since high school: For every section and subsection in your weighted outline (step #5), write a series of bullet points which summarize the main points of each of your expected paragraphs. While everybody seems to know how to do this, step #6 is probably the most difficult to get right, and the one in which most writers get derailed, in my experience. Classic problems include: a) putting just a keyword in the bullet (they should be full sentences, with subject, verb, object1); or b) making the bullets multi-line paragraphs (they should be a summary, not the actual text \u0026ndash; the whole point is to compress the information that will be there once you write the text); or c) making the bullet a vague placeholder (e.g., \u0026ldquo;lessons learned from experiment\u0026rdquo; looks like something you will say over several paragraphs\u0026hellip; OK, what were the lessons? can we get the headlines, or an example?). As a general rule of thumb, your detailed outline should not be more than 20-25% of the expected length of the section/paper (i.e., if it is 5%, maybe it does not have enough detail!).\nWhen this detailed outline is finished, it is quite possible that you will have open questions, parts that you do not like at all, and your own ideas of the paper may have developed a lot by doing this exercise of putting concrete words on paper. This may be a good moment to check in again with your co-authors. You may feel this is too frequent feedback, but think that you are just sending, say, a 4-5 page document, not the full 20-page journal paper. This has two advantages: a) it is quicker to read and understand, and thus easier to fit in their busy schedules; and b) it focuses the feedback on the big ideas, the general structure (not in tiny grammar and formal details that may not be relevant anyway if the structure is modified). If things go well, you will probably get quite a bit of feedback and some useful discussions, and maybe even some changes about the overall approach of the paper. At this point, changes of direction (even large ones) are still OK \u0026ndash; remember that it does not entail ditching entire pages of hard-earned text, only a few bullet points here and there!\n You can find the detailed outline for my example paper here. You can see that my bullet points tend to be a bit complex and convoluted, almost looking like draft text. So yes, I don\u0026rsquo;t follow my own method literally, always. The really important thing here is that you are able to write it more-or-less quickly, and that it summarizes clearly (but concisely) the logical flow of ideas in the text, so that you can get quick feedback about it from your co-authors.  Step 7. Add core tables and figures This step is quite common advice when writing scientific papers. When writing the paper, do not start from the beginning till the end; rather, start from the core, the center, the results of your study. To synthesize the results, very often we resort to figures, charts, graphs, and/or tables. Sometimes, you also have some of those in the methodology, to explain the flow of events in your study, or the experiment protocol, the analysis workflow, whatever. These are very important parts of your paper, to the point that a reviewer in haste will probably just read the introduction (to get an idea of what the paper is about) and then glance through your tables and figures (to understand your main results in a bit more detail than what the abstract says)2. Hence, try to think what tables and figures your results require: what things would be too long to say in text, but would be quite clear and quick in a table or a graph? Quantitative data is an obvious choice, but also qualitative or mixed methods research can benefit from well-designed tables and figures, or photos. Add those tables and figures within your outline, wherever you think they fit within the flow of ideas. Then, if you can get your co-authors to look at them and give feedback, that would be great as well. Very often getting the figures right takes several iterations, as different sets of eyes interpret things differently, or need different amounts of labeling and clarification to understand your data or the point you try to convey.\nStep 8. A third outline with references After so many passes at the paper outlines, and four rounds of feedback with your co-authors, the ideas should be quite settled now. However, I like to insert one step more before drafting text: just add all the references needed by your paper. Probably you have been collecting and having ideas in mind about related work you could cite, and your co-authors probably have suggested some more research literature worth citing. The idea now is to be more systematic: go over each bullet point in your detailed outline, and think what references can support your ideas (or counter them!). You may find that you need to go and search some more papers about certain topics you don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about. That\u0026rsquo;s OK, take some time and search until you find what you need (or leave some placeholder like \u0026ldquo;ref needed\u0026rdquo;, if you want further input from your co-authors). Once you find the right references, add them to the relevant bullet points, using your favorite reference manager3. Once you have gone through the whole outline, you can generate the references section in seconds (that\u0026rsquo;s why you want the reference manager), and see whether your prediction for the length of the references was accurate. If not, you may need to add some, or remove non-critical references.\nAs usual, you can also send this detailed outline with references and figures to your co-authors. This version has all the elements to understand a paper and much of its quality, without the distraction of long stretches of text. Your co-authors can thus give you some ideas for references, and they can still provide feedback on the overall flow of ideas, if needed.\n You can find the detailed outline with figures and references from my example paper here. As you can see, this is already something like a paper, but without the burden of too much text. You can also notice that it is about 3,600 words long. Taking into account that our target journal\u0026rsquo;s maximum length was 6,000, by now it became clear that we probably would not be able to fit this paper into that journal\u0026rsquo;s requirements. Since we really thought that this (i.e., the sequence of ideas in the outline) was the best way to tell this contribution, at this point we started looking at alternative venues which had a similar audience and quality, but less restrictive format.  Step 9. Draft the actual text By now you have gone through the sequence of ideas with your co-authors so many times (about five?), that the message and how to communicate it should be quite clear. In fact, you probably had to repress the impulse to start drafting text already. For me, that is the great advantage of this approach to writing papers: instead of struggling with the blank page and with drafting the text, by the time you reach step #9, half of the paper is already written in your mind, and you are actually glad you are \u0026ldquo;finally writing\u0026rdquo;. Another advantage is that this step of drafting text is (at least for me) so much faster! Depending on the length and complexity of the paper, once all the other pieces are in place, writing the text will take me only about 2-3 full days of work \u0026ndash; much shorter (and much more enjoyable) than it would have been if I had been drafting (and re-drafting based on co-author feedback) all along. When I reach this point, I also make sure that I am using the author guidelines and templates of the target journal/conference4.\nOnce you have completed this first draft of real text, you can put it in the drawer for a couple of days, and take it out of your head. Then, you can come back and read it again (you will probably see typos or things that are not understandable, or that you don\u0026rsquo;t like) and edit your text a bit. Then, it is good to send it once again to your co-authors for feedback. By now the discussions about structure, main message and so on should be over, and feedback will probably be more fine-grained, maybe about style, missing or superfluous details, etc.\nStep 10. Revise, generate final draft and submit! Once you got the feedback from your co-authors, you can edit again the text to consider that feedback. If everyone is happy with the state of the paper, now it\u0026rsquo;s time to submit! Re-check (if you did not do so in previous steps) that you are following the author guidelines and templates of the journal or conference\u0026hellip; and submit the paper to your target venue using the corresponding submission system.\n You can see a preprint of our example paper, with the version that we first submitted to a journal, here. As mentioned in the previous post, the story of the paper still goes on, as this first journal rejected the paper (even if reviewers remarked only minor weak points). Since no big amendments had been made to the core contribution of the paper, after a few enhancements we submitted it to a second journal. The reviewers of the second journal also have proposed a few revisions to it, which have led to the revised version that is again under review.  That\u0026rsquo;s it. \r\r\rMy paper writing process\n\r\r\rThis 10-step process may seem long (mostly because I was not able to shorten more my narration of it), but it is surprisingly efficient. If you ever have tried to draft a paper in a more unstructured way, and gotten a group of engaged co-authors to give you substantial feedback, you will realize how much shorter, time-wise, this 10-step process is (e.g., my first journal paper took some nine months to be written, using a much more chaotic process). To give you a rough estimation, this kind of process makes you spend about 70% of the time planning the paper, 10% drafting actual text, and 20% revising the text with your co-authors. While this heavy emphasis on planning seems odd at first, it is among the best practices recommended by many scientific writing courses5. And there is also some evidence from studies that suggest that students that plan so much at the outset feel more productive and find writing less difficult6!\nCaveats and other disclaimers As I mentioned at the outset of the previous post, this is just my process. It is not the only, or the best process in absolute terms (because there is no such a thing as the perfect process that works in every situation). For some people, starting with the \u0026ldquo;big idea in a sentence\u0026rdquo; may seem impossible. The ideas may not be so clear yet, you feel like you have 37 different things to say about the topic. For those people, sometimes it is recommended to do a bit of \u0026ldquo;free writing\u0026rdquo; first7, which I incorporate into my method as:\nStep 0. Write some text for yourself / Write an internal research report. If you do not know exactly what the main message is, and you don\u0026rsquo;t even feel comfortable generating a few options (see step #1), you can just try to write something. Anything. For 5-10 minutes, write for yourself whatever comes to mind that the paper could be remotely about. You will not show this to others. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother finding the exact right word if it does not come to mind. Go on and write until your fountain of ideas runs dry.\nAnother way of doing this step #0 is to write an internal report about the research you did. Again, write it more for yourself than for others8, explaining what you did and why, and what were your results. Write everything that you think may be relevant.\nThen, try something like reverse outlining on that. Go from the jumbled set of sentences to something like a hierarchy of ideas (with maybe some unconnected ideas as well). See which of those ideas seem more important, interesting, and supported by your evidence or data. Probably that is a good point to start (see step #1). And anyways you will soon put this idea in front of your co-authors, so they can also help you weed out the really important ideas from the more superfluous ones.\nA last disclaimer: the process I presented above looks linear and predictable, right? However, you may find that sometimes you need to backtrack several steps, if you or your co-authors see that a substantial change of direction is needed. Luckily, following this process also minimizes the possibility of drastic changes: you may have to rethink some section weights, move a few bullets around, change figures to match the new main idea\u0026hellip; but probably you will not have to start all over again. And even if you had, throwing 3 pages of outline in the bin is much less painful than doing so with 15 pages of beautifully crafted prose!\nNow is probably a good moment to wrap it up. Stop reading blog posts, and start writing. Believe me, with practice, a certain sense of ease will come. Heck, even enjoyment of writing a paper. I, for one, enjoy writing now \u0026ndash; to the point that I started this blog to write some more, on top of my daily scientific writing! But I still remember the block, the fear of failure, of rejection. It all starts by saying \u0026ldquo;$%$\u0026amp;@# it\u0026rdquo; and writing something. Do a pomodoro. Do only one step of the process.\nDo. It. Now.\nIf you have never used this kind of process for writing papers, why don\u0026rsquo;t you give it a try for your next paper? Then, let me know how it went in the comments below!\n  Pro tip: Extra points if you include also logical connectors to previous/next bullets (i.e., words like \u0026ldquo;however\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;on the other hand\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;besides\u0026rdquo;, etc.), if applicable. I find this really enhances the coherence and readability, not only of the outline itself, but also of the actual text that you will write later on around it. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Of course, this is terribly unfair after you have spent so many hours perfecting every little detail of your manuscript. But these people do exist. And you may cross ways with them. So better be prepared, just in case that happens. And don\u0026rsquo;t even think that doing good, coherent text is not so important then, because in most good journals you get more often the \u0026ldquo;very detailed, I want to understand everything\u0026rdquo; kind of reviewer. You certainly have to write for those readers as well. The main underlying point: a paper needs to enable multiple kinds of reading in an effective way: the very fast, and the very detailed, and anything in between! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n You are using a reference manager. That was not a question. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use one yet, go and start using one right now (your first paper is actually a good moment to start building your reference library). Just do it. You can thank me later. The topic of what is the right reference manager can also span a whole separate post. Personally, I have found lately that Zotero fits quite well my needs and workflow (good integration with Word and Google Docs, good enough Bibtex support, etc.). But I have used different ones over the years, and your mileage may vary\u0026hellip; \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Sometimes I apply these author guidelines and template as early as step #5. This has the advantage of helping you track length more accurately (if the target venue measures length in pages, not words). However, as we saw in my example paper, sometimes we change the target venue mid-way through the writing process. Thus, my advice would be to apply the template whenever you feel that the target venue is well-fixed and will likely not change until submission. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See, for example, Stanford\u0026rsquo;s course \u0026ldquo;Writing in the Sciences\u0026rdquo;. Indeed, this is a very good course on scientific writing in general, if you want to dive a bit deeper in how to get good (or at least, competent) at writing your papers. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Torrance, M., Thomas, G. V., \u0026amp; Robinson, E. J. (1994). The writing strategies of graduate research students in the social sciences. Higher Education, 27(3), 379–392. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See, for example, this other paper writing method by Inger Mewburn (from The Thesis Whisperer, probably the most solid, long-standing blog about PhD issues). Her process looks a bit different (but not that much), and there are quite a few good pieces of advice there as well! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n If you\u0026rsquo;re anything like me, this is actually very useful. A few months after a research project or experiment, I barely remember what I did or what were the results, unless I have a good overview written down somewhere I can find it. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers2/","tags":["Writing","Research","Papers"],"title":"How I write papers (Part 2)"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"There is plenty of advice out there on how to write academic publications, from general stylistic tips to field-specific guides. Yet, I\u0026rsquo;ve found most of that advice tends to be abstract, or focused on the final product, never giving you a step-by-step account of the process. In this post, I share the writing process I find myself using after 70+ academic publications. This will give you an idea of where to start writing your paper (especially if you have never written one), and it will show you that all polished papers have humble (even crappy) origins. Kill perfectionism, and the dreaded \u0026ldquo;academic writer\u0026rsquo;s block\u0026rdquo; will eventually disappear.\nIn a previous post, I went over several reasons why I think scientific writing is difficult for many doctoral students: the lack of specific training, the focus on the finished product (vs. how to get there), the fact that it is a collaborative process, or that many of us don\u0026rsquo;t use our mother tongue when we write. As a way to counter many of those, I thought it could be useful to share what my own writing process is1, which I have come to after more than 10 years of trying (and quite a few \u0026ldquo;loaves of bread sold\u0026rdquo;2). This process assumes that you are collaborating with others, in that it defines when and what to send to co-authors and other collaborators. This is also the process that we recommend in the \u0026ldquo;writing seminar\u0026rdquo; I have helped teach at our university.\nThis may result in a post longer than usual, so\u0026hellip; For those of you that want to get to the point right away and run off:\n\r\r\rMy paper writing process\n\r\r\rFor those of us that need a bit more explanation, read on below. I will try to illustrate each step with an example from a recent paper I co-authored (still under review)3. You will see how different the finished product is, compared with its humble origins:\nStep 1. Define the main idea Once you decide you want to write a paper, start with a blank piece of paper (e.g., a post-it), or a new document in your computer. Do not start from the full report of your study4, or other random pieces of text you may have written during your research about the topic. Blank paper. OK, now, just try to answer in one sentence: What is the paper about? What is the main research contribution5 you are trying to make here? or, in other words, what is the \u0026ldquo;reusable knowledge\u0026rdquo; that you think other researchers need to know, and could build upon? Write that one sentence down. That\u0026rsquo;s it6\n Diving into my archives I found the earliest \u0026ldquo;main idea\u0026rdquo; I had about this recently-published paper of mine: \u0026ldquo;Active or passive [data] gathering? Design-based research studies on technological support for evidence-based teacher reflection\u0026rdquo;. As you can see, this initial idea had quite a few problems (for starters, it was two sentences, not one! plus, what is the new knowledge I wanted to convey is not very clear either). It looks nothing like the final title of the paper. However, it tried to convey that it was about certain studies we had done, and that active/passive data gathering seemed to play an important role in what we discovered. That will have to do for now. Let\u0026rsquo;s move on.  Step 2. Define the audience This one is probably the first point where my advice may deviate from other advice out there. Scientific writing (or any writing, really) is basically an act of communication. And, by definition, it requires a sender (you), a message (see point #1), and a receiver. You have to have one. Pitching a contribution to the wrong audience is one of the most common causes of rejection for scientific papers, so\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t make this mistake. Define who will be interested in the main idea of the paper, who cares about this kind of thing you\u0026rsquo;re proposing. If it\u0026rsquo;s your first paper, you may not be sure, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. But there are things you can do to find out, like a) asking your advisor or more experienced colleagues; b) looking at similar papers you have read: which conferences or journals are they published in? Narrow it down to 1-3 concrete options of journals/conferences. Write them down. Look at the venue\u0026rsquo;s author and submission guidelines. The good thing about setting this from the outset is that now you have already indications of the expected length of the piece, its tone, level of specificity, things the readers probably know already, etc.\n I initially set my paper to be sent to the British Journal of Educational Technology (BJET). The main reasons for this decision were that it was a journal in the field of educational technology, and a really inter-disciplinary one (our paper was neither very technical nor very educational), that it is quite high-quality and high-impact, and that they make a point of publishing research that also has relevance for teachers (which I think our paper idea had)7.  Step 3: Define the team Once you know what you write about and for whom, you can decide who can help you in doing it. In most fields, you do not do your research alone, but collaborating with others (but in some fields it may be required that you write some papers alone \u0026ndash; check with your advisors). This additional team members can be your advisor(s), some colleague who helped you with the data gathering or data analysis8\u0026hellip; but think wider. Is there somebody else you know (in your department, or elsewhere) who knows a lot about the literature on topic X that your paper addresses? or data analysis technique Y? That could save you some time, and this person could bring in new, interesting ideas to the paper.\nThen, send your idea and target venue to potential co-authors: this can be a short email, a chat over coffee\u0026hellip; The main point is to pitch them the idea, see what they think and whether they are interested. In this process, it is good that you set expectations about what their role will be, how much time you think this will take them, what can be the expected author order, etc. All of those can change during the writing process (depending on how the different people behave), but it is good to have some baseline expectation. From this conversation, you can already get some valuable information to help you refine the core idea (maybe they think this is not about keyword X, but rather keyword Y, or they suggest some other venue for publication, or analyses that you had not run yet).\n In my paper\u0026rsquo;s case, I simply told my boss back then, that I was thinking of writing this paper for this venue (he agreed). I also contacted the professional development specialist who had helped co-design the tool we were proposing, and helped manage the data gathering in the school. Later on during the process, I also contacted one of my PhD students, since her topic was closely related to that of the paper \u0026ndash; and she was doing a lot of reading on some of the related literature we needed to cover anyway.  Step 4: Write a pseudo-abstract Now that you have an idea of something scientific to write about, some scholars you want to tell it to, and some people we want to write it with, let\u0026rsquo;s flesh out the idea a little bit more. Not a lot. Just a little bit. I call this step \u0026ldquo;pseudo-abstract\u0026rdquo;, because it more or less has all the elements that a good abstract should have\u0026hellip; only it is not really an abstract (i.e., one paragraph of nice text) yet. It is basically a series of bullet points with simple, clear messages, in three parts9: a) what is known about the topic of the paper (1-3 bullets); b) what this paper adds to such current knowledge, i.e., what contribution(s) it brings (1-2 bullets); and c) what are the implications of this contribution for other researchers, or practitioners, policy-makers or the society at large (1-3 bullets). Keep the bullets as complete sentences, but simple ones (e.g., not more than 100 characters). You can also think about this step as the \u0026ldquo;grandmother\u0026rsquo;s version of your scientific contribution\u0026rdquo; (i.e., how you would communicate this contribution to a non-expert) \u0026ndash; remember, most of our grandmothers are not biochemists or sociology researchers!\n Below, you can see a pseudo-abstract for the same paper, which I did some months later than the original \u0026ldquo;main idea\u0026rdquo;. You can see that the title there has already changed (but still looks pretty generic), and some more ideas have been added, especially regarding what is known about the topic (i.e., what would be the main take-away message from the literature about the relevant keywords, like \u0026ldquo;teacher reflection\u0026rdquo;), and what are the implications (in this case, how a teacher or a school leader could use the tools/ideas we present in the paper).  \r\r\rExample pseudo-abstract from a real paper\n\r\r\rStep 5: Create a weighted outline Now that you have fleshed out the basic idea, let\u0026rsquo;s start thinking about how we are going to write it. A first step in this is to do an outline of the sections of the paper, as you would find it in a table of contents of a book: sections, subsections, sub-subsections\u0026hellip; And, since we already know where we want to send it, we know how long the paper should be (in pages, or words), so we can assign estimated lengths to every section and subsection10. Why do this weighted outline? First, it makes us reflect about the relative importance of the different parts of the text (i.e.: more important parts \u0026ndash;like the paper\u0026rsquo;s main contribution\u0026ndash; should be described in more detail, and hence should be longer). Secondly, and since for many people writing is a bit painful, we do not want to write 30 pages of text on a topic, only to find out that we only needed three pages (so, we have to throw away 90% of that hard-worked text). Furthermore, downsizing text is just plain difficult: once you got used to saying things at a certain level of detail, it has some kind of \u0026ldquo;anchoring effect\u0026rdquo; that makes it very difficult to change our frame of mind (i.e., we think that all we said there is really important to be said). In a sense, making this weighted outline tries to put the anchoring on your side so that you will keep the paper close to the length you actually need.\nOnce you have the main idea (which can be the working title), the co-authors, the target venue, the pseudo-abstract and the weighted outline, it is a good moment to send all this to the co-authors for feedback. This should be a one-page document, so it is more likely that even busy people can give you quickly some ideas about the general direction, section titles and relevant keywords, etc. Once you get this feedback and make the necessary corrections, you can also polish this into an actual title, abstract and outline with lengths, which you can send to the editor of your target journal(s), to inquire whether they think this kind of paper fits the scope of the journal \u0026ndash; and their opinion actually matters a lot, since they are the first filter even before your paper reaches the reviewers! Although they are not obliged to answer, they will often be nice enough to tell you (since by responding, they will get either a good paper, or less out-of-scope papers, later on).\n You can take a look at the weighted outline from my example paper here, which I did still thinking about sending it to the BJET journal, which had a maximum length of 6,000 words. One thing you can notice is that some of the subsections end up being very short (100 words?), which should have made me think that something was not totally right (one-paragraph sections are rare!). Also, the total length was well over 80% of the hard limit (since you also have to count abstract and the other front matter in those 6,000 words). As you will see, these clues became quite important later on\u0026hellip;  More steps\u0026hellip; after the break Wow, this post is getting a bit long! Since we have now reached the middle point within the process, and it was a lot to absorb, I think we can make a break here, until next week. Then, we will go into the details of the paper. As they say, the devil is always in the details but, once the groundwork of these first five steps is there, and you have already gotten feedback from your co-authors a couple of times, you can have some confidence that your shot (and the effort that each step takes) cannot go too far off the mark.\nIn the meantime, why don\u0026rsquo;t you give these five steps a try? Do you have an idea for a paper about some research you did, but you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start? Try this and let me know how it went, in the comments below!\n  The emphasis on \u0026ldquo;my own\u0026rdquo; is important. Writing is still mostly an art (yes, even scientific writing), a very complex skill that requires many smaller skills and abilities, which not all of us can tap in the same way. As they say, \u0026ldquo;your mileage may vary\u0026rdquo;. Even I don\u0026rsquo;t always follow this process every single time (e.g., if I\u0026rsquo;m pressed for time, I might jump a step here and there). This process is just what most of my writing processes resemble, especially if I have some kind of control about the paper (e.g., if I am the first author). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t get the reference, go read the previous post.

Suffice to say that the report is where you describe your full process and results, which are of interest to you and your team. A paper is a wholly different thing, and the audience is normally interested in a small subset of that only. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The topic of what constitutes a valid research contribution is a complex and thorny one, since it varies a lot depending on your research field. In general, it seems that most fields require that a contribution is a piece of reusable knowledge (i.e., you can convey it to others and they can reproduce it and build upon it), which is relevant to a certain scientific community (e.g., astrophysicists, engineers, linguists, whatever your field is), which is novel (i.e., new and non-obvious), and has some kind of usefulness (but this one varies a lot from applied to more basic/theoretical fields). Furthermore, you have to provide some evidence that all of the above is true (be it with mathematical proofs, data from empirical studies, or whatever method your field considers valid). In the end, the goal of the paper and its different parts is basically to prove your point on all these regards! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Pro tip: instead of writing the one idea in a piece of paper, try writing three different main ideas in three post-its, and then choose the best one (or pitch them to a colleague). You can even go further and try what in design circles is called \u0026ldquo;crazy 8s\u0026rdquo; (i.e., eight different ideas for the main contribution, in 8 minutes). Try to make each idea meaningful, different from the previous ones, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry if they end up being crap. That is the whole point of the exercise. For empirical proof that this seems to help both the quality of the outputs and your own feeling of self-efficacy, see, for example, Dow, S. P., Glassco, A., Kass, J., Schwarz, M., Schwartz, D. L., \u0026amp; Klemmer, S. R. (2010). Parallel prototyping leads to better design results, more divergence, and increased self-efficacy.

In case you\u0026rsquo;re curious, the main reason for the eventual change was that our draft ended up being much longer than what the journal allowed. This was in part due to my lack of discipline when writing, and the fact that we chose to tell our contribution in a way that could not really be made much shorter. Even when we changed our target journal to another one more adequate to the manuscript length, but with similar characteristics to BJET, our paper was rejected (i.e., the reviewers did not appreciate the contribution enough). Thus, we had to improve the paper based on some of the reviewer feedback and find yet another journal to submit it to \u0026ndash; where it is now under review. In retrospect, I\u0026rsquo;d say that this last journal was probably the best choice anyway (it\u0026rsquo;s just that we did not even know about this journal at the outset when the paper started). This is worth taking into account: no plan survives contact with reality \u0026ndash; but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have one. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Who should count as co-author in your papers? This is another topic for an entire post, but for now: anybody that made substantial contributions to the design, data gathering, analysis or interpretation of the evidence; AND helps you drafting or revising the paper; AND checks out the final version for publishing; AND agrees to be responsible for its contents. You can check out things like the Vancouver Convention, or this very complete site from the Norwegian Research Ethics Committee. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n This kind of structure is used in many journals, under the name \u0026ldquo;highlights\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;practitioner notes\u0026rdquo;. Basically, they are aimed at summarizing the paper in a nutshell, in relatively simple language, so that other scientists and people that are not necessarily experts in your field, can understand them\u0026hellip; which is precisely what we want to do at this point! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Pro tip: journals and conferences normally offer a hard maximum length limit\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t target that number! make it about 80% of the length limit, or even less if you think the contribution should be shorter. You will probably go over your target length anyways during the writing of actual text \u0026ndash; and shortening text is both painful and difficult. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/","tags":["Writing","Research","Papers"],"title":"How I write papers"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"Writing (papers or the dissertation itself) is one of the activities that many doctoral students hate the most. Why is this act of communication so difficult for us? As a prelude to my post on \u0026ldquo;how I write papers\u0026rdquo;, I expose some misconceptions we seem to have about scientific writing and what are good ways to learn it.\n Scientific writing is one of the most dreaded tasks for many Ph.D. students1, and understandably so. Unless you are in the humanities, you probably signed up to \u0026ldquo;do science\u0026rdquo;: do experiments, gather evidence, analyze data, read tons of books\u0026hellip; not to become an accomplished writer! To make matters worse, doctoral programs have surprisingly little training on basic (and specifically scientific) writing skills. It seems like we either assume that 1) people come to the doctoral level already knowing how to write scientific texts; or 2) it is such an easy skill to master that it\u0026rsquo;s pointless to teach it. Lets look at these two assumptions:\nIt is an easy skill. Sadly, for most doctoral students, their scientific writing training is reduced to \u0026ldquo;read a lot of scientific papers and you will get it\u0026hellip; eventually\u0026rdquo;. But probably you see the problem here: it is quite difficult to acquire a skill to make something just by seeing finished products (i.e., published papers). This is a bit like training bakers to make bread, just by showing them finished, beautifully decorated loafs of bread and baguettes. Imagine bakers not being encouraged to get their hands dirty with flour! Luckily, our bakers probably get proper vocational training in which they see how their products are manufactured from start to finish. As a consequence, I have yet to meet a baker that is terrified of making bread.\n\r\r\rA baker scared of bread\n\r\r\rPeople already know how to write. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s what our primary and secondary schools are for, right? or the bachelors, or the masters. The problem is that scientific writing is a very particular genre, with values and criteria that are quite different from literary writing (which focuses on aesthetics or emotional impact), political or marketing writing (focusing on persuasion, when not obfuscation), or the kind of \u0026ldquo;composition piece writing\u0026rdquo; that many of us learned at school (which focuses on piling up text until you have X number of words). This kind of \u0026ldquo;writing by accumulation of words\u0026rdquo; leads to doctoral student texts often lacking structure, preciseness, and being an over-long mishmash of ideas. Scientific writing focuses on logical argumentation, clarity of concepts, unambiguity, traceability of sources\u0026hellip; very, very different from any other genre. Coming back to the baker metaphor, it\u0026rsquo;s like trying to make soufflés when you have been doing coarse whole-wheat bread all your life (it might not occur to you that texture is important, or that you can actually put sugar in these things!).\n\r\r\rA baker not used to sugar\n\r\r\rAside from these two misconceptions, there are plenty of other complicating factors, like the fact that English (the dominant language in most scientific fields) is not the native language of a big majority of our doctoral students. Most of our training as writers has probably developed in an entirely different language. Try to make a soufflé after growing up somewhere in Asia where wheat or milk were rare or unheard of\u0026hellip;\nAnd there is yet another difference between scientific writing and other genres: it is, more often than not, a collaborative process. Although, as a doctoral student, you find yourself writing mostly on your own, chances are that you will get feedback from your advisors or other colleagues at some point. During the publishing process, reviewers and editors will also help you make a better paper out of your ideas (even if we do not always perceive it as a collaboration). This collaborative nature of scientific writing begs many questions: at what point should I share my ideas with collaborators, and in which form? is it better to do it often or rarely? what if they are too busy or too slow? et cetera. Again, if you have never baked bread with other people, it may be puzzling who should do what, and at what point in time.\n\r\r\rCollaborative bakery is not easy\n\r\r\rThese misconceptions and differences (along with the fact that more senior researchers and advisors seldom recognize having difficulties in writing) lead to students being ashamed when they have writing problems, which in turn leads to anxiety, \u0026ldquo;writer\u0026rsquo;s block\u0026rdquo;, etc. Maybe this is also why I seldom get the question \u0026ldquo;How do you write papers?\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, you did not ask for it but\u0026hellip; In the next post, I will share the step-by-step process I find myself following after (collaboratively) authoring and publishing more than 70 scientific papers. The misconceptions and issues that I just described have shaped that writing process, as well as the principles behind it (my \u0026ldquo;10 commandments of writing\u0026rdquo;, also in a later post). For now just remember that, as a Ph.D. student, you are not alone in these hardships. We all faced them. We all learned\u0026hellip; eventually. More or less.\nTalk to others.\nSee how they get out of their writer\u0026rsquo;s block.\nDo you agree with these problems and misconceptions?

I hope that the awareness of these factors (from gender to other things you can actually change in your everyday life) will help you understand why some people struggle doing a PhD, while for others it seems a piece of cake. Change what you do and put the odds on your side!\nAs we have seen, depression and anxiety are an increasingly common ailment of Ph.D. students. So much so that, if you don\u0026rsquo;t experience these symptoms yourself during the Ph.D., chances are somebody else around you (e.g., a colleague, or a friend) will.\nThe good news is that many of these studies that determined how frequent mental health issues are in the Ph.D., also investigate what factors seem to correlate (and how much) with symptoms of anxiety or depression (or stress in general). Let\u0026rsquo;s review the most common ones.\nThe Big Five As it often happens when you start reading research studies on anything, each study is a bit different, measures things differently, was done on a different population\u0026hellip; so it is hard to have a single, very accurate picture. Yet, there are five factors that appear again and again in the studies on doctoral student mental health:\n Gender: In many of the studies I have read gender was discovered to be significantly related with depression and anxiety symptoms. For instance, in a recent study, women were about 17% more likely to be depressed than men1, and in another around 27% more likely2. Often, the effect on anxiety is even higher than on depression3. Being trans-gender or being gay have also been related even more strongly with depression (in different studies, trans were 60% more likely1, and gay were almost 4 times as likely than heterosexuals3). Why is this? Multiple things can be at play: the fact that many academic fields are still male-dominated (and heterosexuals dominate in almost any population), which can lead to students not feeling like \u0026ldquo;they belong\u0026rdquo;4; or the fact that, in many cultures, women tend to have less difficulty in expressing their emotions, which is what many of the mental health questionnaires ask about (so, rather than men not being depressed, they might just be hiding it more)5. Strong social ties are another factor that appears very often in these studies. By this I mean really close social relationships like having children (which lowered the odds of being depressed by about 35%2). In many of the studies, being married or having a stable partner also were related with lower rates of depression (in one study, 42% lower odds of depression3). It looks like having somebody to talk and support you through the hardships of the doctorate, or someone that really clarifies your priorities (as a crying baby often does), can be quite protective against the rumination and thought patters that lead to depression. Economic situation is another one that comes up quite often: not surprisingly, having problems making ends meet does not help with anxiety and depression. However, the effect varies a lot from study to study, and from country to country, from 5% more chances6 to almost three times more likely to get depressed3. Even the economic situation of your parents seems to have this effect7 And the problem is, in most countries, being a PhD student is a low-pay, high-workload job. Related to this issue, how do you perceive your career prospects (i.e., will there be a good job for you after the doctorate) is also mentioned in several places as having an impact in the mental health of PhD students5,8. Work-life balance. This one is not very surprising either, and it is named and measured in different ways: family-work conflict, job demands vs. job control, \u0026hellip; People that perceive their work-life balance to be unhealthy, are more than twice as likely to be depressed1, and experiencing work-family conflicts can also raise your odds of depression between 30-50%2. High job demands (defined as \u0026ldquo;physical, social or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical or mental effort\u0026rdquo;) also seem related to depression (60% more likely2). Conversely, having high job control (of your work environment, pace of work, timing of breaks, etc.) seems to lower the chances of depression by about 40%2. Supervisor relationship. This is the one many of you were waiting for. Researchers have dedicated a lot of effort to study this factor from different angles, like the prior expertise of the supervisor, the supervisory style, leadership style\u0026hellip; However, the results here are rather heterogeneous, and their importance varies a lot8. People who perceive their supervisor as not providing mentorship, support, or emotional impact, were 50% more likely to be depressed in one study1, while in some other research, having an \u0026ldquo;inspirational\u0026rdquo; supervisor lowered the odds of depression by about 10%2. In the same study, having a \u0026ldquo;laissez-faire\u0026rdquo; kind of supervisor raised the odds of depression/anxiety symptoms between 4-8%. In general, this issue of the supervisor style is quite difficult to tackle, as it seems to be also very cultural, and very personal (some studies mention that the important thing is that supervisor and student styles are compatible). I will dedicate a separate post to this issue alone.  There are plenty of other factors that have been studied, but either their change in odds is small9, or there is not enough agreement about them across studies. There is also the issue of whether these factors are causes or effects. When reading this, one should bear in mind the old adage: \u0026ldquo;correlation is not causation\u0026rdquo;. Most probably, the relationship between depression and these demographic and contextual factors is quite complex, with confounding factors and feedback loops. The way I see it: the Ph.D. is a highly uncertain, intense, ill-defined process where often long stretches of time pass without any meaningful feedback about whether you\u0026rsquo;re making any progress. Hence, it is crucial to have a variety of social (and economic) support to remind you that you are a worthy human being (and to lower the stakes of such huge effort).\nBut wait, you may say: why are you telling us about these risk factors, if they are all things we have little control about? It is not like we are going to have kids or change gender just to protect ourselves from depression. It is true that these demographic factors are the most studied so far, probably because they set some kind of baseline, your starting point for the odds of being depressed. But, once you know this starting point, this is when the fun begins\u0026hellip;\nWhat can you actually do? One interesting thing about many of these studies on risk factors for anxiety and depression, it that they run these regression models on multiple factors, which includes some measures of how predictive they are. For example, some paper2 might tell you that their R-squared was 0.2, meaning that their model (taking into account supervision, gender, and several other things) explains only 20% of the variance of the data. That also means there is an 80% of the variance (read: whether you get depressed or not) that must be due to other things: personal factors, individual circumstances and events, etc. This is compatible with the arguments of many positive psychologists, which say that our happiness is a composite of genetic factors (about 50%, according to some accounts), our current circumstances (10%), and an ample 40% for what they call \u0026ldquo;intentional activity\u0026rdquo;, i.e., things we can actually do to change our happiness levels 10.\nSo, has science also studied what Ph.D. students can do to avoid depression and anxiety? Yes. Kinda. Truth is, the evidence on these is normally from smaller, non-representative populations (e.g., there is a ton of studies on just psychology doctoral students). Thus, there are not big guarantees that the results will apply to you. In any case, here are a few ideas:\n  Sleep. Having healthy sleep habits is one of the most powerful correlates against depression across studies. And it maybe the one that appears most consistently across the studies I\u0026rsquo;ve read, both when studying stress 11,12,5 and depression13 of doctoral students. Hence, if you found in my first blog post that you might be at risk of depression, and you see that sleep can be a problem for you, maybe trying to fix your sleep hygiene14 is the first thing I would try. If just fixing your sleep hygiene does not cut it, I\u0026rsquo;ve had quite good results with progressive muscle relaxation exercises, but you can also look around in the web for other techniques, or go to a sleep therapist.\n  Social support. This is the other big, consistent contributor to avoid depression across studies 5,12,15, as already hinted by some of the other factors mentioned above. One might think that our social circles (i.e., how many friends or acquaintances we have) are not really under our control. However, there are things one can decide to do, like seeking help (one study7 found that help-seeking behaviors are relatively rare among depressed students, only about 30%), or joining a writing support group8, if your university has one. Heck, just heading out for a social evening with friends or colleagues can take you out of your rut if you do it wholeheartedly (even if it is, of course, the last thing you want to do when you are in a depressed mood).\n  Exercise. This is another well-known one. However, from the studies I\u0026rsquo;ve read the effect is not always clear: in some studies it is found as a protective factor against psychological ill health16, in others it is not significant12, while in others it is correlated with higher stress! (although the authors argue that this is due to students already using exercise as a coping strategy against the stress that is already there)11. In general, I think it is safe to assume that being in good physical health makes you less prone to falling into depression5,17, so keeping some exercise routine, eating healthily16, etc. is probably a good idea.\n  Mindful acceptance. Now we come to the less-well-known ones. I was quite surprised to find some studies looking at this trait in students, and finding very large effects or correlations with lower perceived stress (more than twice as much as the sleep hygiene in one study12, and also found significant in others18). Despite the new-agey name, this is not to be confused with practicing mindfulness meditation (which was not found a significant predictor in some of the same studies, once you control for this acceptance trait12). Looking around, I found definitions like \u0026ldquo;experiencing events fully and without defense, as they are\u0026rdquo;19, or \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; one lets go of judgment, interpretation, and/or elaboration of internal events, and makes no attempt to change, avoid, or escape from the internal experience [\u0026hellip;] not to be confused with passivity or resignation\u0026rdquo;20. While this might look like a fixed personal trait (you either accept stuff, or you don\u0026rsquo;t), there seem to be ways to train it21. Another topic to dig deeper in a later post\u0026hellip;\n  Cognitive reappraisal. Loosely defined as reinterpreting an emotional episode22, this kind of mental technique was found to correlate with lower stress in some of the studies on doctoral students12, but was not found significant in all of them18. Again, I make a mental note to dig deeper into this one, and see if there are easy practices or habits to develop it.\n  Put the odds on your side In summary, it seems that there are a few demographic and contextual factors that seem to be related with higher chances of depression and anxiety - but while they seem to be cumulative, they are not ultimately decisive. Everything in life is a bet, so for this one:\n If you are a Ph.D. student, it is probably good to know your base chances, given the factors above\u0026hellip; but also to know what you can do to prevent it (or at least put the odds on your side). Along with the diagnostic tools we saw in the first post, this gives you a basic toolkit to see how you\u0026rsquo;re doing, understand that many in your position have had similar trouble, and do what you can to help yourself or seek help. If you are thinking of starting a Ph.D., maybe take a look at these factors. If you tick many of the \u0026ldquo;bad boxes\u0026rdquo; above\u0026hellip; this does not necessarily mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it. Diversity is one thing we need in many fields, science included. But rather, understand that it may get difficult at times, that you need to brace yourself, be especially careful in the preventive side and go for it if that\u0026rsquo;s what you want! If you are a supervisor (or a university decision-maker), you may want to check with your students: what is their economic situation? do they have a social circle to support them? are they sleeping? You cannot take many lifestyle choices for them, but there are things among these factors that you can influence (maybe rethink that \u0026ldquo;laissez faire\u0026rdquo; strategy, if that\u0026rsquo;s your advisor style). If your are friends or family with a Ph.D. student, you can also do a quick factor assessment, and be especially attentive if the odds look bad; check in with them from time to time, get out and spend some quality time with them. As you saw above, that alone can go a long way. Telling them about these studies probably won\u0026rsquo;t hurt either.  Despite the depressing tone of all this, do not despair! I also see every day doctoral students that are curious, engaged, having a blast learning to be researchers. Knowing that other, darker paths exist, and knowing your odds, is just a start towards avoiding them. Let us see what other things we discover to keep ourselves on the bright side of science.\n  Evans, T. M., Bira, L., Gastelum, J. B., Weiss, L. T., \u0026amp; Vanderford, N. L. (2018).

The good thing about this questionnaire and the whole concept of \u0026ldquo;sleep hygiene\u0026rdquo; is that it is habit- and environment-based, so in order to improve it, you only have to start changing your habits and environment towards fewer of these bad habits (which is something you have quite a bit of control about). \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Quina Galdino, M.

But at some point, I realized that other, more selfish, reasons were playing out as well. In this personal account I reflect on a chronic problem of academics and Ph.D. students alike, and how I face it through this blog.\nI open my eyes. It\u0026rsquo;s 6:30am. I do not have to wake up for another hour or so. I know my body and my brain would benefit from sleeping again, but it\u0026rsquo;s no use. I\u0026rsquo;m wide awake.\nIn bed, I spend an indeterminate amount of time revising the never-ending list of to-do\u0026rsquo;s for the day: meetings that I dread about administrative tasks and topics that I\u0026rsquo;m barely interested in, reports and funding grants I have to write, emails apologizing for the (now chronic) delays in the latest experiment I\u0026rsquo;m trying to run\u0026hellip;\nAt some point I catch my train of thought: this circular revision of obligations is useless, everything is anyways noted down in my trusted task list. I try to focus a bit on how my body is feeling. The familiar sensations are back. The small knot in the stomach. The tension in the jaw. The heaviness in the eyes. My mind races again, churning new problems - including the fact that I have too many problems. After another while, I decide to get up and do something. Should I catch up with yesterday\u0026rsquo;s emails? Write up a bit more of the latest paper draft, which has been festering in my hard drive for the last months? I extend my arm out of the bed, towards my phone.\nI stop right there, arm in the air. What\u0026rsquo;s important now?\nI get up, go to the kitchen, and I sit down for a few minutes, doing nothing, just trying to follow my own breath. Of course, it is useless. The latest student report that needs feedback, the document for the bid of the new software, all come back around my head. But I try again for a few more minutes. Back to the breath. The class I need to teach later today. Back to the breath.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read enough about this to know what is happening. Today is one of those days. As the day unfolds, I expect some of the other symptoms of low-grade anxiety1 and depression2: the veil of negativity when people propose well-intentioned solutions and ideas to help me (it is so easy to see all the ways in which such ideas can fail), the upwelling of emotion at semi-random moments (sometimes inspiring to the point of tears; but more often as despair, or even despairing at other people\u0026rsquo;s inspiration).\nAnd the reader will surely think: what are you complaining about? You have already your Ph.D., you have a stable(-ish) job in academia, no big personal troubles\u0026hellip; You\u0026rsquo;ve been lucky, you are successful already! That\u0026rsquo;s the salt rubbing on the wound: shouldn\u0026rsquo;t success feel great? Why does it taste of overwhelm? Truth is, success never stopped successful people from feeling depressed or suicidal (ask Kurt Cobain, or these long lists of famous suicidal scientists).\nI get up from the chair, somewhat more focused. I lay down on a yoga mat and stretch for a few minutes. Then I sit down and write. I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel like it. Yet, among the many worries, also one or two ideas had appeared about things that could be useful for others.\nI type furiously. Some sentences seem brilliant, and the hope that they will inspire somebody to change what they do and feel better almost makes me cry. Stupid. After a few sentences, the fountain of words in my head seems to dry up. I stare at the screen. I can feel the fear of failure tightening its grip on my chest: what if people don\u0026rsquo;t like this either? surely others have written about this more eloquently, and with more knowledge than mine? worse, what if nobody reads it? I force myself to write a few more words, not even complete sentences. Just endings or beginnings, like pieces of stairs leading nowhere. Sometimes I cringe at the words that appear on the screen. But I leave them there for now. Probably today\u0026rsquo;s negative frame of mind is not the best to judge their value.\nTwenty-five minutes later, a faint bell rings. The knot in my stomach is still there\u0026hellip; but somehow, it feels less important. My head is a bit clearer. I look at the page. This is not a blog entry yet, only some jambled sentences, keywords and a lot of \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. But it is a beginning3. Somehow, I feel a certain sense of achievement. I have some power for change in the world. Not much. Only a tiny little. Maybe just a percent of a probability of helping somebody, of making the world less of a grim place.\nThis is the second reason why I write these jambled things. Not only to help with something I see around me more and more often: at the university, at home, among my friends and other people of my age. The young professional that stands frozen in his car, prey of an anxiety crisis. The friend that died of a heart attack at 36 due to overwork. And many more like me, with much lighter symptoms. We are among you. And we are legion.\nThe second reason I do this is to help myself out of it.\nOf course, not everyone is like this. There is those people that have the twinkle in the eye, the zest in the voice, which always seem to have ideas, to speak passionately, to inspire while they teach. Maybe I was one of them only a few years ago. But maybe some of those are also like us. I have learned to mistrust outward appearances (or Facebook feeds, for that matter) of success and happiness. The struggle inside, the impostor syndrome, the secret failues \u0026ndash; those we never see. The halo effect when we see others, and the negativity bias when we look at ourselves \u0026ndash; what a dangerous cocktail!\nYet, what can you do? Well, you can start with a couple of things:\n Talk to others about how you feel. Believe me, getting things off your chest (to your partner, to your boss, to a trusted colleague, a close friend or the waiter at the bar) will feel better than just marinating your brain endlessly with them. They might surprise you with the revelation that they feel the same. Or they will give you a different point of view, point out the many positives in your life, or at least show you that they understand. Of course, you will not agree. You will not believe them. Not at first. But let those things marinate in your head for a while\u0026hellip; Find a purpose. Any purpose4. It can be volunteering at your local charity, creating Youtube videos to help others cook delicious meals, the smile of your baby at 4am (just when you thought you were about to kill him). Or it can be how your research will help cure diseases, advance human knowledge or lead to a better world for everyone. Find something that gets you up in the morning (maybe not every day, but most days). And use it. Remind yourself of it.  I will be here.\nWriting.\n  If you are curious about anxiety and its symptoms, there are plenty of resources online to educate the general public about it, such as this one at the Mayo Clinic, or this other one. If you want to check yourself for these symptoms, you can resort to widely-used self-report tests like the GAD07. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Similarly, for the curious about depression, you can read this, this, or assess yourself with tests like the PHQ9. And, of course, you can check out my first post on depression in the Ph.D. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n To give you an idea, writing this blog entry took about 4 mornings like this one. Plus a bit more time for editing and making it ready for publication. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Please note I didn\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;follow your passion\u0026rdquo; or something like that. I\u0026rsquo;m under the impression that looking for a purpose out of ourselves, bigger than ourselves, might work better than following a \u0026ldquo;passion\u0026rdquo; for cycling, Swedish movies, or collecting cars. But let\u0026rsquo;s leave such psycho-philosophical discussion on purpose for another entry\u0026hellip; \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  ","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/posts/second-reason/","tags":["Personal","Wellbeing","Anxiety"],"title":"The second reason why I write this blog"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been using for many years. I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, how to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!\nIt is 8:00am. The apartment is quiet and in semi-darkness (the winter sun still hasn\u0026rsquo;t gone up). I put my phone in silent mode, and keep it away from sight. As I sit down to start writing this blog post, I go to my browser and click on the small tomato icon, which turns red, signaling that I have nothing else to do in the next 25 minutes, but write.\nWhat I just described may be quite familiar to some of you: it was me using \u0026ldquo;the pomodoro technique\u0026rdquo;. If somebody asked me which one productivity technique or lifehack I would take to a desert island with me for the rest of my life, it would be this one. By far.\nBut wait, wasn\u0026rsquo;t this blog about PhD students and depression stuff? Well, yes and no. In fact, once people are depressed, probably what they need is a therapist/specialist (not a blogger) to help them out of it. Here, I focus more on the preventive side: how to keep yourself effective and happy so that you finish the PhD and enjoy the ride as much as possible. Once I started looking at the current science of happiness (or \u0026ldquo;positive psychology\u0026rdquo;, as they call it), it seems that having a sense of self-efficacy (read, being and feeling productive) seems to play a large role in it1. So no, not all posts will be depressing - and yes, productivity tips, tricks and routines will feature here from time to time.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s get back to the Pomodoro\u0026hellip;\nA bit of history The Pomodoro Technique (R) (yes, apparently it is a registered brand) is generally attributed to Francesco Cirillo, who developed it in the 1980s, as a university student looking for \u0026ldquo;a way to get more done in less time\u0026rdquo;. Since then, it has become a very popular \u0026ldquo;lifehack\u0026rdquo;, and now there is an entire book by Cirillo about it2, training courses and certifications, etc. In any case, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t build your whole work life around it, it is a nice little trick to know, and something you can adopt in your own life, right now.\nThis technique is very often used by knowledge workers in many industries, from software development to design, and I know for a fact that many researchers (no matter whether they are early PhD students or seasoned professors) swear by it when they try to stay productive. Oh, and where does the name come from? basically, from the Italian for \u0026ldquo;tomato\u0026rdquo; - Cirillo used a kitchen timer with the shape of a tomato, when he first developed the technique in university.\nHow to do it In case you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go to down to Cirillo\u0026rsquo;s official page (or any of the other dozens of websites and blog posts already describing it), here is a very brief primer on how to start \u0026ldquo;pomodoring\u0026rdquo;, right now:\n Choose a task you want to get done (works especially well for tasks you alone can do, which you\u0026rsquo;ve been procrastinating on). Put away all distractions, especially your phone (which should be put in flight or silent mode) but also email notifications in your computer and other known interruption sources. Make an oath to yourself to work on this task (and only this task) for 25 minutes without interruption. Then, set an actual timer for 25 minutes (some people like physical kitchen timers, but small computer apps also work). Work on the task for the alloted 25 minutes without interruption. Come on, it\u0026rsquo;s just 25 minutes, you can do it! When the timer rings, make a mark on a piece of paper3 and take a break (typically, 5 minutes). Well done! Take a minute to congratulate yourself for advancing in that long-procrastinated task. I\u0026rsquo;m serious. Then, breath, get off your chair, drink a glass of water, stretch, meditate, whatever. That\u0026rsquo;s it4  Did you do it? How did it feel? Let me know in the comments.\nThe science behind the tomato Despite the technique being mentioned in every other book and article about productivity and graduate students5, there is surprisingly little scientific literature about its use and effectiveness. Aside from several case studies of how it was adopted by different software development firms6, the only real studies I found trying to see if this technique really worked for people was in the field of human-computer interaction, where people design apps to facilitate the practice of the pomodoro, and then evaluate the app (not the method per se). One such study7, about an app that blocks distracting sites in your phone and computer, found that people that used the app did more pomodoros, and felt less stress (the authors argue that it is because you off-load the responsibility of keeping yourself on task to the app). But all these studies tend to be quite small-scale and exploratory.\nOf course, there are plenty of conjectures out there (by Cirillo and others) about why the technique works: because it helps you re-frame time as an event you use to achieve something, instead of a resource you are running out of; the fact that it matches the human attention and focus span; its emphasis on taking breaks periodically (which we too often ignore); etc. But, in the end, it seems that most people supporting it out there, do so out of personal experience. That is also why I recommend it myself: it has worked for me. My guess is that, if you are not a procrastinator, you always get your things done in time and effortlessly\u0026hellip; then, this is not for you. But if you feel overwhelmed by your to-do list (or you don\u0026rsquo;t have a to-do list!) and tend to distract yourself too easily from the important stuff, maybe trying this for a week can change your life forever.\nCaveats As I said, the Pomodoro has been one of my central productivity tricks for many years, and it has helped me greatly when I find myself procrastinating or overwhelmed by obligations at work. However, that does not mean that I use it absolutely all the time. As noted in the Pomodoro booklet and in some criticisms to the technique, there are times when avoiding the Pomodoro is probably a good idea:\n Do not use it when you know you will be interrupted. If you are in your office hours and students are probably coming to see you, or when you are in meetings or your work requires intense teamwork, then it is probably better to not do pomodoros (as it will likely be frustrating to handle what you will see as interruptions). Thankfully, some of the activities in a Ph.D. are solitary almost by definition (e.g., reading, writing your own research), so you will have plenty of opportunity to use the little tomato! Do not use it in your free time. This may seem obvious, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been guilty of trying this myself. As we will see in later posts, resting and unscheduled free time are an essential activity that should be preserved (in the same way sleep is an important part of an athlete\u0026rsquo;s training). Making pomodoros out of leisure activities (e.g., reading a novel for fun) makes them goal-oriented, and will suck the fun out of them very quickly.  Personal experience, tips and tricks In the many years I have been using the Pomodoro technique, I have come across several realizations, tips and tricks about it:\n The timer: When I first discovered the technique, I went out and bought a physical kitchen timer. There was a certain enjoyment in the physicality of setting the timer and hearing the soft tic-tac, but I very soon discovered that not everyone found it as soothing as I did (nor the loud ring at the end!). Since most of my working life occurs within (or nearby) a web browser, I used this nifty little website for a while, and now I use the Marinara Chrome extension. If those options do not fit your particular situation, just pick whatever is easy to call up within your daily routines and workflow (you can Google around for \u0026lsquo;pomodoro timer\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;pomodoro app\u0026rsquo;). I do not recommend using a phone app (the device is often too full of notifications and other potential distractions to outweigh the benefit of the pomodoro). The space: I\u0026rsquo;ve found that how you implement the pomodoro is not as important as where you do it. Choose carefully a space where you are quite sure that no one will interrupt you, and that you will not interrupt or distract yourself. This often rules out your own office, or your kitchen (if you are prone to fridge trips). My personal favorite as of today is the library at our university, as it is close by, it\u0026rsquo;s quite silent, has comfortable chairs/desks, and probably no one is looking for me there8. The distractions. I cannot emphasize this enough: turn off email notifications, and any other notification in your computer (if you are going to work at the computer). And do yourself a favor and put away the phone - really away, as in \u0026ldquo;off your sight, in another room\u0026rdquo; away9. Unless you are expecting a call from the hospital where your grandma is hospitalized, this alone is a productivity tip in itself: once I removed all notifications in my computer (and most of the ones in the phone), my productivity, capacity for attention and general happiness improved markedly. Multi-pomodoro chunks. This is already built-in if you follow Cirillo\u0026rsquo;s full Pomodoro methodology as described in the book. But even if you don\u0026rsquo;t: there is a benefit to doing, say, 4 or 6 pomodoros in a row. There is only so much you can do in 25 minutes, and for really difficult, analytical or creative tasks, a single pomodoro just gets you started. Hence, set aside 2-3 hours for these important, hard tasks, and do several pomodoros in a row, focused on the same task (still taking breaks, but not starting a different task). Peak stress use: I use the technique most intensely (and reap the most benefits from) when facing \u0026ldquo;peak stress\u0026rdquo; moments. Sometimes you have a hard, complex deadline coming close (e.g., when preparing an experiment, when writing a paper or a funding proposal you cannot postpone), and you realize there are still 10-20 different things you need to do in only a few days. In these cases, I just make a list of the tasks, decide their importance, dependencies and sequence, and then budget a number of pomodoros (up to the number of pomodoros I can realistically do in the few remaining days) to each of them. Then, I commit to doing the best I can in the very limited time allotted to each task, but no more (a use of the Pareto principle - you often can get 80% of the results with the first 20% of your efforts). The results are not perfect (tip: they never are), but they are much better than the alternative - an even lousier job due to not sleeping at all, or total breakdown and failing to meet the deadline at all. Effects on mood: Although I only have subjective, anecdotal evidence of this, I have observed that the days when I manage to use this technique more consistently, seem to correlate with more intense feelings of effectiveness and accomplishment. In general, not only more stuff gets done, I\u0026rsquo;m just in a better mood throughout the day! Collective pomodoros: This one is mentioned in Wang et al.\u0026rsquo;s paper6, and I know of Ph.D. students that work in the same office that have used it. Basically, a co-located group of people agrees certain stretches of time to synchronize and do pomodoros together (even if everyone works on their own thing). This social variant of the pomodoro has several intuitive advantages, like reducing interruptions from your co-workers, and allowing for nicer breaks in which you can socialize with your office mates, feel less awkward stretching, etc. In a sense, this is similar to a \u0026ldquo;Shut up and write\u0026rdquo;, to which I will probably dedicate a separate entry in the future.  Just do it. Now. This post just scratched the surface of what the Pomodoro technique can do for you10. If you have read so far and you have not done a pomodoro yet, now it is the time to do so. Go back to the step number 1 above, choose the most important and difficult thing you have to do today, and do a pomodoro. Just one. Just now.\nA small notification appears in the lower right corner of the screen: take a small break. I look at my screen: the text is still convoluted and long, far from perfect, but not too bad for only 25 minutes of work11. As I get up and stretch my arms over my head, I revel in the feeling of having created something (even if it is an incomplete, imperfect something). It was worth the time.\n  Ryan, R.

If you get distracted or interrupt yourself to do something else, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to make this mark. If you do more pomodoros about the same task, or about other tasks during the day, this alone can be a primitive way of measuring your productivity. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n There is an additional step, which I consider optional: If you are doing multiple \u0026ldquo;pomodoros\u0026rdquo; in a row, take a longer break (say, 15 minutes) after four of them. Take a walk around the building, go chat with somebody, do some burpees\u0026hellip; do not spend this longer break doing email! (I\u0026rsquo;m often guilty of this one, but then it is not a break) \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See, for example, Lackey, A.

There is lots of general advice out there on how to do diagrams (e.g., for your literature review papers), but not so many that are directly useful for defining the thesis itself. Of course, there are too many research fields and traditions out there, so this particular structure may not fit your particular situation. But I suggest you give it a go - you may be surprised!\nOrigins I first came across this thinking tool when doing my own Ph.D. at GSIC-EMIC, a inter-disciplinary educational technologies lab at the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Back there, it was common advice to fill up one such diagram, once your thesis topic was more or less defined2. Spending an hour diagramming quickly made you realize that things were not as clear as you initially thought, and that your research contributions had more holes than a piece Gruyère cheese\u0026hellip;\nI originally thought that this was just a common researcher device in use everywhere, pretty much like Ellis\u0026rsquo;s problem-goal-question schema3 \u0026ndash; also very recommendable, by the way. However, my later travels around different labs have convinced me that this kind of exercise is not common at all (which is why I think this post can be useful). Thus, the diagram is a truly \u0026ldquo;home-brewed\u0026rdquo; thing4, which evolved in an iterative manner since its first (partial) appearance in Asensio-Pérez\u0026rsquo;s thesis5, throughout several other theses6,7, my own thesis8 and beyond9. We all modified it slightly to fit our particular needs. And we all agree that it was a very useful device to define, understand and communicate our own research.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s hope it helps you too.\nWhat it is As you can see in the thesis references above, the diagram is commonly used in the introduction section of a dissertation, and it is meant to introduce, in graphical form, some of its main elements: the research Context, main research Question, Objectives, Contributions of your thesis and their Evaluation. However, many of us have also used it way before starting to write the dissertation book itself, as a \u0026ldquo;guiding star\u0026rdquo; when discussing with others and planning the thesis work. Below you can see an generic example of such a diagram10. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at each of the elements that make it up:\n\r\r\rA generic CQOCE diagram\n\r\r\r Context. As in, \u0026ldquo;research context\u0026rdquo;. This box is meant to convey where your research sits within the scientific community or communities that are close to what you do. At the beginning of your Ph.D., this box may contain just the name of 1-2 research fields, and/or very general topics within them that interest you. However, as you read more and more literature and understand your field and what is interesting for you, it can become quite specific (see the examples from my own thesis below). Generally, it is also very important to lay out here what is the main problem that you have detected in current research, the \u0026ldquo;hole\u0026rdquo; in the current state-of-the-art that your thesis intends to \u0026ldquo;plug\u0026rdquo;. This basically gives the why of your thesis: what is wrong with our current knowledge of the world, that your thesis tries to make right? Research Question. Probably one of the most obnoxious habits of old professors that one meets randomly during the Ph.D., is to ask: \u0026ldquo;Oh, so you are a doctoral student here\u0026hellip; and what is your research question?\u0026rdquo;. This often leads to the student answering evasively and trying to scurry away. Aside from its obnoxiousness, this question has another interesting property: it is very good at signaling the maturity of a student. If you are able to understand that you are here to further human knowledge, you have identified clearly something that is not known, and formulated it in a single sentence that is actually a question and can be answered with data in a reasonable amount of time, you are almost 50% of the way there (yet another reason why making this diagram is useful). This main research question is probably the element of the diagram that changes most often throughout the Ph.D., normally in the direction from \u0026ldquo;very general, almost impossible to answer even with unlimited funds and manpower\u0026rdquo;, to \u0026ldquo;very specific and convoluted, but with some chance of being answered by a single person in a few years\u0026rdquo;. Objectives: This box tries to answer the question of how would you go about finding out the answer to your research question above. However, it is not really a plan yet: rather, it tries to \u0026ldquo;decompose\u0026rdquo; your research question into more manageable elements, either conceptually (for instance, looking independently into different concepts/keywords that appear in your main research question) or temporally (dealing with A is needed before trying to investigate B). Contributions: This is probably the trickiest element of the diagram to fill in, and the one which I get most questions about. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do a separate post on the whole \u0026ldquo;What counts as a research contribution?\u0026rdquo; question, but here goes the two-sentence version: It is whatever previously unknown, reusable knowledge that you propose or produce during your research, which materializes the answer to your research question. The main problem is that what counts as valid knowledge depends a lot on your research field - which is why you need more experienced peers (like your supervisor, or reading papers from other people in your field), to guide you in defining this. For instance, in many fields (especially, applied ones), a research contribution has to be: a) novel (nobody has done the same or a very similar thing); b) feasible (it can be done practically, it is not just some futuristic fantasy); and c) useful (something that solves an important, relevant problem for some stakeholder). Another tip: very often (but not always), contributions are linked to the different objectives you laid out in the previous box (e.g., each objective is materialized in a contribution that fulfills the objective). Evaluation: Once you have decided what your contribution(s) is/are, you only need to prove that it works as you say it does, e.g., that it is novel, feasible and useful. In many fields, this involves gathering data of some kind from the world, using whatever means at your disposal (from huge radio-telescopes to asking a single person in an interview). This box thus tries to represent graphically how the different data gathering events that you organize, provide this proof for the value of the different contributions you define, to meet the objectives and finally answer the research question of your thesis (see the over-complex examples from my thesis in the figure below).  If all this sounds terribly abstract and vague to you, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you are in good company (everyone thinks so at the beginning). Hopefully, an example will help bring some clarity\u0026hellip; but then again, maybe not, if you are in a field very far away from mine. Therefore, take the example if it helps you, but do not consider it the only way of doing this!\nHow I used it during my Ph.D. Going through my archives from the thesis period, I have found at least 18 different versions of this diagram (hence, not counting those I quickly drew on paper and never made it into my hard drive). Below, you can see three examples spanning the three years that my Ph.D. work lasted: a first one from about six months into the actual Ph.D. work (hand-drawn on the left, mostly in Spanish), another one from around the middle, and the final one that appeared on my dissertation (on the right).\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rCQOCE diagrams for my own thesis, from the beginning of my thesis work (left), mid-way through it (center) and at the defense (right)\n\r\r\rA lot can be said about those particular diagrams (parts of them still make me cringe), but there are three take-aways I want to leave you with: a) your diagram should probably look much simpler than mine (my thesis was too complicated, for reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t need to discuss here); b) it is OK to hand-draw yours (it is often quicker, and has the same communication power); and c) as you can see in the middle one, it is OK to have incomplete or doubtful parts in it. That is the whole point of the diagram: to identify what parts we are unsure of, or have no idea how to deal with, and see how the conception of our own dissertation is changing over time.\nFast-forward six years, and I still use this kind of diagrams when starting a new research line, especially if it is a collaboration with other researchers, and I have to communicate what the main idea and elements of the research are. Which leads me to\u0026hellip;\nWhy use it - and when not to There are several reasons why you might want to give this exercise a go (or recommend it to your students, if you are an advisor):\n It is a useful reflection exercise: In the day-to-day life of a Ph.D. there are so many different tasks, reading papers, planning experiments, gathering data, doing analysis, writing your own papers\u0026hellip; It is very easy for each of these to become a rabbit hole we pursue. Sometimes these meanderings are useful and prompt a permanent change in how you think about your thesis (they become central to it). Sometimes they are just unnecessary distractions. This exercise forces you to stop for a moment 11, and think deeply, and make your current ideas about what you are doing (and why) visible. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ever show it to anybody else, knowing your direction (or even whether there are gaps in your ideas) feels tremendously empowering. As a reminder and prioritization tool. Once you have a version of the diagram in place (even with holes or question marks in it), you can print it and keep it somewhere visible in your office or workspace. And every time you are analyzing data, or reading an interesting paper, or writing your own, or coming up with ideas for cool experiments, you can look at it and think: does it fit or relate with my main problem? is it central or peripheral to it? does it further my contributions? And depending on what your answer is, you can give it a clear priority compared with your other tasks and ideas (or reject it completely\u0026hellip; until you finish the Ph.D. at least). Or you can quickly draw a new box in the diagram, if you think it is really important. Although the two values above are very important, I think the real killer application of this diagram is as a communication tool: It summarizes, in a single page, what the most important question and ideas of your thesis are, and what you are trying to achieve. It also forces you to decide what the right keywords and terminology to use (something different scientific communities are known to be quite picky about) - and elicit problems with the words you use, once you present it to others. You can use it in your meetings with the Ph.D. advisor (to front-load your topic in your advisor\u0026rsquo;s exhausted/busy brain), in the introduction to any of your thesis reports (to get the reader to understand how this piece fits in the whole puzzle of your work), whenever you have to write for a \u0026ldquo;doctoral consortium\u0026rdquo; or other kind of short presentation about your doctoral work, \u0026hellip; heck, you can put it even in your Ph.D. defense presentation12!  However, not everything about this exercise is great, and there are several circumstances where I would not necessarily recommend to use this:\n If you know for a fact that your advisor (or whatever audience you plan to use it with) dislikes diagrams. \u0026ldquo;Diagrams discourage deep thought and argumentation\u0026rdquo; - I have gotten this remark sometimes from very respected academics, and maybe they have a point. The diagram is not a substitute for a thoughtful, well-argued text (or conversation) describing where your research question comes from and what your contributions are. It is rather a complement - even if it is a very useful one! If you feel that making it is taking too long, or you are endlessly nitpicking about terminology, or you are putting off other important tasks in your Ph.D. to do this (i.e., the diagram has become an act of procrastination). Aside from fully focusing on it when you do it, I also recommend to \u0026ldquo;timebox\u0026rdquo; it13. Remember, this is a tool best used in iteration and communication: rather do a half-baked one in one hour and discuss it with somebody, than spend a whole week on it and end up unsure of whether it is the perfect version (tip: it never is). If you and everyone involved is crystal clear on what the topic is, or you have your topic and contributions well described somewhere else in relatively short form (e.g., in your initial Ph.D. research plan) - provided that nothing much has changed in your ideas described there. If you want to highlight the research methodology you use (a glaring omission in the current version of the diagram) or other kinds of temporal structure or tasks/plans in your Ph.D.. There are other representations more adequate for that kind of thing, like Gantt charts or other task-flow diagrams (I also used some of those in my thesis - maybe a topic for a future post?). If you\u0026rsquo;re not taking the exercise seriously or you think it is utterly useless. But this is a general rule: never do anything you think is meaningless, if you can avoid it :)  Try it out\u0026hellip; and let me know how it goes That\u0026rsquo;s it. I hope this small tool is useful for you in progressing towards a complete dissertation. Now, this diagram is most useful if you actually go and do it. Get off your seat, go for a walk, then sit down again for one or two hours (with your phone in flight mode). Paint it with colored pencils, hand-draw it in the back of the proverbial napkin, or make a copy of this one for use in your computer, whatever. Bonus points if you then share it with your advisor or a colleague or anyone.\nJust do it \u0026ndash; and let me know how it goes in the comments.\nAlso, do you have other diagrams or thinking tools that helped you greatly in advancing in your PhD? let me know in the comments below - I\u0026rsquo;ll be glad to share other tools like this in the future.\n  See, for example, this post by Jason Fried. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Contrary to other universities/faculties, in that field and university it is common to start the Ph.D. with a vaguely-defined research topic and questions. In other places, an initial Ph.D. proposal already has to have a quite clear research question, methodology and research plan behind it (at least, on paper). The diagram could also be very useful even to develop such initial research proposal. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Ellis, T. J., \u0026amp; Levy, Y. (2008).

Is this problem real and, if so, how bad is it? In this post, I review several recent studies, some of which also offer insights about potential risk factors. This also kickstarts the whole idea of this blog, as a way to increase awareness about these difficulties, and offer practical tips and tricks to survive such a difficult period.\nThe other day I encountered a colleague at the university. When I first met her, more than two years ago, she seemed a very active, positive person, with an iron will and lots of initiative, a true go-getter. Now, when I talked to her, she still smiled, but a light inquiry into how things were going quickly revealed her many struggles, from unhelpful supervisors to problems with some of the software she has to use on a daily basis. Subsequent times we\u0026rsquo;ve met recently have led to similar exchanges: \u0026ldquo;everything is a problem\u0026rdquo;, is one of her most frequent sentences now.\nOf course, many things may have happened for this person to change her attitude so starkly, but there is one thing I know for sure about her: she has been doing a PhD for the last two years. And I have been around PhD students long enough now, in different labs and different countries (including my own PhD) to know that this is not an isolated case. Interestingly, when I was a knowledge worker in the industry, such emotional downturns were relatively uncommon, so\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s going on here?\nWell, doing a PhD is hard. Anyone will tell you that, from the university professor, to the baker whose cousin is a lab rat. However, we often understand that as: oh, you have to be really smart to do it. But maybe it is not the smarts (or lack thereof) that makes it difficult.\nI recently crossed this problem again in the generalist press, and apparently this topic appears in the news from time to time. It just seems to be largely ignored, or thought to be \u0026ldquo;the way things are\u0026rdquo;. But the first link above referenced a couple of concrete, recent research studies, so I decided to start digging\u0026hellip; is there more to this than my subjective perceptions?\nWhat the some research says Apparently, some researchers must be getting worried about this, because I found quite a few interesting studies done in the last couple of years. For instance, a recent study on more than 2,000 graduate students from 26 countries1 found that about 39% of them had moderate or severe depression symptoms (and 41% of them had moderate/severe anxiety symptoms). This does not mean much (who is not depressed these days with all the fake news and stuff?) until you read that the prevalence of depression symptoms in the general population is less than 6%2! Another study done in Belgium last year3 found similar rates of mental health symptoms (30%-50% depending on the severity) in more than 3,600 PhD students. There, they also do a comparison to understand how high that is: the prevalence of the same symptoms in \u0026ldquo;highly educated\u0026rdquo; general population is around 14%-27% 4. In a study in Brazil, about 21% seemed to be the prevalence of major depression symptoms in graduate students 5. Going a bit back in time, and to other countries, we find different numbers: 8.9% (France, 2010 6), 27% (Turkey, 2008 7), 13% (US, 2007 8), or 5% (Brazil again, in 1995 9)\u0026hellip; It is interesting how data varies quite a lot from country to country (but also for the general population, symptoms for depression in Brazil are 22% in the latest study, vs. the 6% of Germany), and over time (in the Brazilian 1995 study they mention a general population prevalence of 2%!). On top of that, other factors can be at play, like selection bias (not all studies are from cross-sectional or representative samples).\nThe studies also point out some factors that seem to correlate with such symptoms: gender, having children or a partner, perceived work-life balance, or quality of the student\u0026rsquo;s supervision. Some of these vary from study to study, but many seem to be common. There is quite a lot to be said about this topic of what seems to correlate with depression in doctorate students, so I will cover that separately in an upcoming post.\nConclusion Then, the question remains: are you at a greater risk of depression if you do a PhD? It seems that it depends a lot on where you are in the world: in a country where people may have already other reasons for depression generally (like Brazil?), the number is quite close to the general population; but in a relatively \u0026ldquo;happy\u0026rdquo; country like Germany, the chances of being depressed seems to multiply by 5 or more if you are a PhD student!\nIn absolute terms, across studies, the most recent numbers seem to be that around 25-50% of students show moderate or severe depression symptoms. That\u0026rsquo;s one in four, up to one in every two students! Certainly something to watch out for.\nIn practice - a call to action And how is this useful, what can you do now that you know this?\n If you are a PhD student and you\u0026rsquo;re feeling a bit down (and chances are you have felt this in the past, or will in the future), at least know that you are not alone. This is not to say: \u0026ldquo;yeah, this is normal, so buckle up and go on\u0026rdquo;. Mental wellbeing is just as important as physical health (but we talk much less about it, and it is a well-known taboo in many societies). If we start coughing and feeling dizzy, we try to self-diagnose (e.g., with a thermometer), and if it seems serious, we go to the doctor. Well, there are questionnaires like the PHQ-9 (used in many of the studies above), which you can take in order to get an idea of how bad it is. At the very least, talk to somebody, anybody you trust - and if it\u0026rsquo;s bad, go to your doctor, or an specialist! If you are friends or family with a PhD student, you can just keep a friendly eye on them, check in with them from time to time, maybe point them to this blog if you think this information can be useful for them. And if they mention many of the symptoms that appear in these self-tests, maybe suggest them to self-diagnose or see a doctor. If you are a supervisor, you can periodically interest yourself in your students\u0026rsquo; morale and again suggest self-diagnosis or seeing a doctor if you think something is going on. If you think all this talk of depression is nonsense (\u0026ldquo;nobody cared about my depression when I did my PhD!\u0026quot;), think again: will anyone benefit if your student drops out (or worse) tomorrow? Your research won\u0026rsquo;t, for sure. In a later post I will also write about the whole students dropping out issue. If you are considering to do a PhD, think about this carefully, and consider yourself warned. True, thousands of people do PhDs successfully every year, but that does not mean there is no suffering on the way; a PhD can also be one of the happiest, most fulfilling episodes of your life (at least mine was so for the most part). Just be aware of the risks (see a later post for more about the risk factors and correlates). Be prepared. For me, personally, as a novice PhD supervisor, this has motivated me to learn more about these mental wellbeing issues, and other techniques and tools to help my students be more productive and (why not) happier during the PhD. I want to be prepared to help others. I will be documenting my discoveries in this blog, and I hope you will find them useful.

Here I will share actionable, practical tips and tools that I (and others) have found useful about the art (?) of becoming a researcher and helping others do so.\nI will try to look at problems and situations that many PhD students face, which are not field-specific: from productivity to wellbeing, from conceptualizing your research to writing it up or going to scientific conferences. As much as possible, I will look at what actual research is there on the subject, and propose tips, tricks and tools that may help navigate these situations.\nHowever, do not expect the formal, measured, academic tone of a peer-reviewed publication. This is a blog, not a scientific journal. I hope it will feel more like a conversation with a colleague in a bar, about the everyday problems and solutions that we encounter as we learn to do science and help each other to do it better.\nI hope this blog also becomes a catalyst to create awareness about these seldom-mentioned problems and situations. A place for people to come and talk about these issues, to pose problems, ask questions, suggest solutions, or tips or tools to cover.\nIt is going to be an exciting journey.\nAbout me I am a relatively recent doctor, starting to supervise my own PhD students. Despite my arguably short scientific career, I am amazed at the variety of supervision styles and workplace dynamics that I have seen in different fields and labs, and the wild variety of doctoral student experiences resulting from it \u0026ndash; many of which are not very productive or healthy. I have the impression we are selling our students short, just because we were sold short ourselves.\nI am also surprised to find that many of my more experienced colleagues seem to face the same hurdles and issues that I find, and shrug defeatedly when I ask for solutions. Much of the written advice I\u0026rsquo;ve found on supervision was either too abstract, or too specific to one field or a particular situation or institution. I wonder if there are not patterns, practices, solutions that people have found as they do this for decades and decades. I have found a few that worked for myself and people I know, and I will share them here.\nIn summary, I am just a beginner on this. I hope to learn a lot by investigating and writing about this, and I will be glad to have you come along.\nDisclaimer The advice in this blog (especially when I write about delicate issues like mental health and depression) is not a substitute for a experienced researcher in a particular field, or a professional therapist. However, whenever possible I will point to research or self-diagnose tools that may help you determine whether you need more expert advice.\n","permalink":"https://ahappyphd.org/about/","tags":["About"],"title":"About"}]
