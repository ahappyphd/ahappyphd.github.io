[{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"Continuing with last week\u0026rsquo;s post on \u0026ldquo;happiness at work\u0026rdquo;, in this post I explore the first of the four pillars for a happier workplace: the sense that your work has a purpose, that it is personally meaningful to you. Read on to learn to self-assess your sense of purpose at work, and get some ideas on how to make your research work feel more meaningful.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rImage by Wokandapix from Pixabay\n\r\r\rP is for Purpose As it happened with \u0026ldquo;happiness\u0026rdquo; last week, many people will feel that this term is too fluffy and vague to be practically useful. For sure we cannot define (or measure) our sense of purpose as researchers, can we? The course on \u0026ldquo;happiness at work\u0026rdquo; defines purpose as the feeling that you make valuable contributions to others (or to society) that you find personally meaningful, and don\u0026rsquo;t harm anyone. Apparently, there are studies that show that people that work are happier (on average) than people who do not work \u0026ndash; but people that feel purpose at work are even happier!\nThere are several typical avenues to get work to feel meaningful:\n if your work serves a purpose beyond yourself (e.g., I\u0026rsquo;m trying to find a cure for cancer), if it provides opportunities for self-realization (in the form of learning and personal growth, or some other kind of recognition of achievements), if it provides some kind of status and/or the opportunity to acquire and exercise power if it provides social opportunities, such as making you feel you belong to a community, that your ideas are listened to, or that you have freedom to decide what to do and how to do it  Looking at these avenues, one would think that doing a Ph.D. has many elements to feel like meaningful work: you are working to further human knowledge (sometimes even with clear practical applications), acquiring new knowledge and skills, getting recognition (e.g., in the form of publications or citations), being part of a local or international scientific community\u0026hellip; however, this is all very personal. The key issue is whether you perceive these features of your work.\nDo you?\nDiagnose your sense of purpose As a way to self-assess how much you feel this sense of purpose in your work, you can try another couple of research-validated instruments, answering them with your research/dissertation work in mind (i.e., not considering any other job/work you may be performing in parallel):\n The Calling and Vocation Questionnaire (CVQ), based on the work by Dik et al.1 The Work and Meaning Inventory (WAMI) by Steger and colleagues2  How did you do in these questionnaires? If you did not score very high, do not despair. Many, many researchers have worked for their whole lives without a big sense of purpose about their research (maybe their purpose is about other aspects of their lives, like their family or volunteering outside their job). Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why the notion of being happy at work is so foreign to many people. But if this is something you want to change for yourself (and research suggests it can change3), read on for some practices that might help.\nAct: Practices for purpose The course suggests several ways to find more meaning at work, although does not go too much into specifics. After digging a bit more into the literature and other readings, I found a few concrete things you could try out for yourself. However, rather than seeing them as isolated tricks, I\u0026rsquo;d wager they build upon each other:\n Find your values. It is difficult to find meaning in your research if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what things are intrinsically important to you. What are your core values? Don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what to answer (I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what were the possible options!). In the hubbub and busyness of the everyday getting-things-done, this kind of question seldom appears, and we take it for granted. Thus, a good first step would be to take some off time to introspect, to reflect on what are your core personal values. I have found several useful concrete exercises for this (I would try all of them, since each one uncovers different aspects of them)4:  Try out the simple practice of \u0026ldquo;affirming important values\u0026rdquo;. This seems to be especially useful when you ego has taken a hit or we feel evaluated/judged0. The Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) investigates how much weight you put to different values that seem to appear across cultures. There is no right or wrong answers. The results of this one I have found enlightening, not only to better understand myself, but also the people around me (conflicts often arise just because we value some things and we take for granted that everyone else shares the same values). Although not so research-based, I have also found this reflection exercise5 to be quite useful to put things into perspective. It takes some more time (maybe an hour), but it is worth the time, especially if you still feel that you don\u0026rsquo;t see a clear meaning or purpose about your life.  Job crafting. Once you know what your core values are, what is meaningful for you, then you just have to find work that aligns with those values. Easy, right? Not really. The research we do, especially during the PhD phase, is seldom fully defined by us, and it is very difficult to make big changes in direction once the research has started. One potential way out of this conundrum in the positive psychology literature is \u0026ldquo;job crafting\u0026rdquo;6. In very simple terms, job crafting is about redesigning your work tasks, your relationships at work, and your thoughts about work. Even if you have limited freedom to do such things (especially as a PhD student), all of us can do small tweaks on what kind of tasks we do more often, who and how we interact with, and how we think about what we do in our research. Try out these resources (in order of increasing complexity):  You can just take a look at the items of the Job Crafting Scale by Tims et al.7, or the Job Crafting Questionnaire by Slemp et al.8, as they ask about concrete behaviors of job crafting. See if you can do any of those in your own research work! This article introduces job crafting in more detail, including exercises and examples. If you want to get really serious about it, there are more detailed training materials, like this one by the University of Michigan, where this concept originated  Remind yourself regularly of the meaning that research work has for you (as discovered in the previous steps). This is one of the job crafting behaviors as well, but it is worth mentioning separately, as it is easy to implement with very little time/effort/cost. Two examples of concrete and easy practices:  Simply, make that core value or mission your \u0026ldquo;monday mantra\u0026rdquo;. Write down your main values or mission (the ones that are relevant and aligned with your research work) in an index card or in a post-it, and keep it with you, in your nightstand, or in a visible place where you work. Just look at it occasionally, especially when your morale falters. If you want to take this practice up a notch, try journaling at the end of the day about how your workday went\u0026hellip; but also reflecting how it aligned (or not) with those important values, and how you could take concrete actions in the future to improve this alignment.   In case you want a visual summary to remember all these tips and tricks, here it goes:\n\r\r\rFinding purpose in your research work\n\r\r\rOver to you Purpose was the first of four \u0026ldquo;pillars\u0026rdquo; of happiness at work. I\u0026rsquo;ll let you in on a secret: when I did many of these tests myself months ago, I did pretty badly (2 out of 5 in the CVQ, for example). In a sense, starting this blog was part of my own job crafting, of finding work that better aligns with my values. And it worked for me. Indeed, I\u0026rsquo;m even considering starting some small research studies related to the topics of this blog as well (which hopefully would align some of my work tasks even more with my values). Stay tuned for more info on that!\nWhat about you?

However, we all know someone that seems to enjoy greatly their work, even their dissertation work (heck, I have to confess I\u0026rsquo;ve been one such annoying person myself sometimes). What things make people love their work? Apparently, an entire branch of positive psychology has been delving into this question for decades. This post is the first of a series that adapts insights and practices for greater \u0026ldquo;happiness at work\u0026rdquo; from a massive open online course (MOOC), to the work life of doctoral students (and academics more generally).\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rUser:Jathin.d [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\r\r\rBack from holidays! Re-charged or depressed? I am back home after a long summer hiatus that included conferences, working in the peculiar \u0026ldquo;summer mode\u0026rdquo; of many universities (when you don\u0026rsquo;t have to teach, have less meetings and maybe can concentrate more on new or dangling research projects), and some actual holidays away from email and other connectedness. There is a strange feeling of reset. Like a blank slate, the new academic year is full of possibilities, new things to explore\u0026hellip; but also the dread of old commitments, meetings and other stuff I have put off, still waiting to ambush me in the next weeks. This kind of \u0026ldquo;post-holiday blues\u0026rdquo; is, I guess, quite normal as we contrast the relative freedom of schedules and actions during holidays, with the restrictions and routines of our usual work life.\nHowever, these feelings also reminded me of a bigger question I\u0026rsquo;ve often pondered: given the limits to our autonomy that work life represents (and since autonomy seems to be essential for happiness), can we really be as happy and fulfilled at work as we are on holidays?\nIt turns out there is an entire branch of psychology (positive organizational psychology) dedicated to that kind of question. In the last months I have been doing a massive online open course (MOOC) from UC Berkeley called \u0026ldquo;The Foundations of Happiness at Work\u0026rdquo; which introduces you to many basic concepts in this area. While the course seems rather geared towards human resources professionals, it also has some interesting topics for the individual worker (and thus, to doctoral students and supervisors as \u0026ldquo;research workers\u0026rdquo;). To answer the question above, I will try to distill and adapt some of the most actionable insights from this course, in this and the following posts.\nHappiness at work I can already feel some of you raising a skeptical eyebrow when reading the title above in all its fluffiness and squishiness: how can you define, or measure something as subjective and personal as \u0026ldquo;happiness\u0026rdquo;? Psychologists (and philosophers) have been trying, though. A lot. In the course, the instructors make the point that happiness is not about momentary positive emotions, pleasure or hedonism, or being in a perpetual state of cheerfulness. Rather, they provide a working definition taken from S. Lyubomirsky\u0026rsquo;s work, \u0026ldquo;the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.\u0026rdquo;1 Still fluffy, but probably most of us can agree that these are things we generally want.\nIn the course, they also make the case that workers in this state tend to be more creative and more productive, thus creating benefits for the organization\u0026rsquo;s bottom line. In a similar way, I think the supervisors among us can probably agree that Ph.D. students in this kind of \u0026ldquo;happy state\u0026rdquo; are likely to be more productive as researchers than depressed ones (not to mention the fact that it is more ethical to want people to be happy, rather than the opposite). Nevertheless, in this series of posts I will focus on the individual, personal perspective on how to achieve such happiness at work, not the organizational view of how to create a research lab with this kind of atmosphere (which is also interesting, but maybe for a later post).\nDiagnosing: How happy are you in your (research) work? One interesting thing they do in the course is they give you self-diagnose tools (in the form of research-validated questionnaires), to assess yourself regarding the different ideas and constructs of interest. For example, take a minute or two to do the following questionnaires, answering the questions from the point of view of your research/dissertation work:\n Questionnaire on job satisfaction, based on Cammann et al.\u0026rsquo;s MOAQ2 Questionnaire on overall happiness at work, based on Lybomirsky and Lepper\u0026rsquo;s work3  How did you do? If you scored high, good for you! maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t need many of the tips and practices I\u0026rsquo;ll mention in the next posts (maybe you do them already!). If you scored low, then read on, you may get some useful ideas on how to improve your sense of happiness at work. Back when I did these questionnaires some months ago, I scored around 4.7 out of 7 \u0026ndash; not too bad, but certainly a lot of space for improvement!\nActing: Looking for PERKs in your research work Another interesting feature of the course is that it proposes actions or practices to improve this sense of happiness at work. These actions are gathered around four main areas, four pillars of increased happiness at work, which go by the acronym \u0026ldquo;P.E.R.K.\u0026rdquo; (probably, the pun was intended). The next post will focus on the first of these pillars\u0026hellip;\nCan you guess what the P stands for (as something important to make you happier in your work life)?

This week\u0026rsquo;s short \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantra\u0026rdquo; goes at the heart of such unproductive self-talk. What is all this really about?\nI am finally back from a couple of weeks of scientific conferences and visits to other labs. The physical tiredness of the trip (despite my efforts to pace myself) is more than compensated by the excitement of hearing about interesting new ideas, new methodologies to apply, contacts for future collaboration, and a big pile of references to new research I want to read. However, one also brings back the memory of quite a few unsuccessful attempts at scientific communication (be it boring talks or abstruse papers).\nThis got me thinking about scientific communication. Despite all our good will (no one tries to be boring on purpose), our foibles often trip us up when we try to tell others about our research. We mumble away when asked about our current research, we undercut our findings\u0026rsquo; interest in front of the famous professor or, worse, we try to make slides that are over-complex or full of formulas, to show \u0026ldquo;we can do math\u0026rdquo;.\nI believe that, behind many of these failed attempts at scientific communication, are different insecurities, impostor syndromes and other related flavours of unproductive self-talk. We feel inadequate, judged by our audience, confronted with them like they\u0026rsquo;re the enemy. The best advice I\u0026rsquo;ve heard regarding this kind of situation (from different people and in slightly different forms), is this:\n\u0026ldquo;This is not about you\u0026ldquo; \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rBest advice I\u0026#39;ve heard about scientific communication and science in general\n\r\r\rYes. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\nDespite what your ego might let you think, the presentation, the slides, the pitch\u0026hellip; none of this is about you. It is about the work. The findings. The new knowledge that you found and the evidence that supports your claim. Nobody is there to judge you particularly. They probably don\u0026rsquo;t even know who you are. But they care about these new ideas you present. They are curious, like you. They want to learn.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong: we are all self-referential. We are the protagonist of most of our thoughts because\u0026hellip; well, we are the protagonist of everything that happens around us, it seems. This is all natural. However, when such self-referential patterns of thought (i.e., about me, myself an mine) get out of control, we get into trouble. Self-referential thought patterns and rumination have been repeatedly linked with depression and social anxiety disorder (those feelings of inadequacy in situations where we present ourselves in front of others). Having a lot of comparative thoughts (are we less smart than others? is our work worse than others\u0026rsquo;?) has also been linked with depression1.\nIn general, many of the ugly episodes in the otherwise placid academic life, happen when people make the research be about them personally, not about the knowledge: the battle of egos between two prestigious professors, the \u0026ldquo;asshole supervisor\u0026rdquo; that exploits students for his own benefit, the obsession with publication and citation metrics\u0026hellip;\nConversely, if you look at great scientific communicators, those inspiring researchers that leave you wanting to dedicate the rest of your life to their topic, seem to have an opposite focus:\n They believe (and make you believe) that their topic or research problem is incredibly interesting They focus on how their new findings can be made digestible by others, connected with their experience and knowledge They make clear how the new knowledge (note: not themselves) can be useful for others They make sure you understand to what extent their findings are reliable (or what weaknesses or alternative explanations are there) They provoke audiences to interact with their ideas (rather than trying to crush them with their superior knowledge)  The next time you are present in a very good scientific talk, try to notice whether the speaker makes it about them, or about the work. Chances are it will be the latter. Also, notice how you hear the talk: are you really interested in the speaker? or are you rather there to hear about interesting new findings?\nDo you have some scientific communication tasks to do this week? Try it out. If you read my previous post about the Monday Mantras, you know the drill: take a paper card or post-it, write the mantra on it, put it on your nightstand or somewhere you will see it, carry it around with you, put it very visible, and reflect shortly about it before you prepare your communication work. See if it makes a difference.\nDid you find this short prompt helpful when thinking about your scientific communication tasks?

As a doctoral student, probably even more so. In this post I share a selection of advice and tricks to make your next conference more pleasant (and useful in the long-term). Go forth, and enjoy a few days of \u0026ldquo;geeking out\u0026rdquo; with fellow researchers!\nAs I pack my bags to go to the CSCL conference in Lyon, I find myself wondering if I am prepared enough, and whether I have been doing conferences \u0026ldquo;the right way\u0026rdquo; all these years. To quench my own curiosity, and in the hope of helping if you still find attending to such conferences daunting, I\u0026rsquo;ve read around the academic blogosphere, and added further tips from outside academia and from my own experience1.\nWhy go? Going to conferences is a very common piece of advice for things to do during your PhD. And I fully agree. Going to international, high-quality conferences in your field\u0026hellip;\n \u0026hellip; allows you to get the pulse of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in your area of research: kinds of research contributions, methods, data that are accepted; latest trends; etc. \u0026hellip; helps you to know the people that make up the community. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that putting faces to your references, or hearing how they describe their ideas in talking (formally or informally), helps you get the knowledge that the community is developing. \u0026hellip; enables you to present your work to those people. You get feedback to improve it, are more likely to be cited, and you will probably understand better how your work integrates with the rest of the field (which is essential when writing future papers).  But, once you decide you will go to a particular conference, and maybe got your work accepted for presentation there, what do you do? how do you prepare? how do you behave there? This post gives some tips about that. It is not detailed advice on the whole process of going to a conference for the first time (as others have already written excellent posts and more posts about that).\nTake care of yourself People (especially outsiders) tend to think of an academic conference in some faraway place as a sort of holiday, relaxing on the beach at the taxpayers\u0026rsquo; expense. Nothing further from the truth: after sitting still in uncomfortable chairs for several hours, straining to understand often-unclear presentations (or doing email if you finally desist on that), engaging in deep intellectual discussions over coffee breaks, and preparing your own presentations over the evening/night, you are likely to be quite taxed, physically and mentally. Some tips to keep yourself effective and lively during such days:\n Look at the schedule and plan your rest before the conference starts. Go to bed and get up so that you get the amount of sleep needed to be full of energy during the conference. Take small breaks during the day (NB: doing email does not count!) from the intense intellectual and social activities of the day. For instance, spending some time on your own seems crucial to recharge if you are an introvert (like many of us academics). Pace yourself: it is tempting to try and be in every session that remotely interests you, in every party or extra session, or social event. However, rushing for the whole day is not the most conducive state for a good learning experience: you will not be really paying attention to the current presentation, rather thinking where you have to run next. Rather, set minimums or \u0026ldquo;most important\u0026rdquo; goals for each day of the conference (e.g., go to the presentation by X, which is closest to your topic, and talk to her; have two good conversations, with business cards exchanged; etc.). This is similar to the \u0026ldquo;most important tasks\u0026rdquo; (MITs) approach to productivity, which I have mentioned in previous posts2. And if you find yourself tuning out of presentations, take a short break \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s probably a better use of your time than zombi-ing through presentations for the rest of the day! If you drink at all during conferences (an entirely personal choice, depending on how well you take this well-known social lubricant), handle your alcohol carefully: have lots of avocado before the party/reception, hydrate yourself (e.g., have one glass of water for every alcoholic drink you get), and drink \u0026ldquo;clean drinks\u0026rdquo; (some people recommend NorCal Margaritas), to avoid hangovers and other adverse effects of alcohol-enhanced \u0026ldquo;networking\u0026rdquo;. Which provides a nice segway to\u0026hellip;  Make meaningful connections Networking is arguably the main purpose of any academic conference. However, this kind of social activity can be hard on introverts or socially-awkward people (which abound in academia).\nThe word networking evokes images of slimy, self-centred people shaking hands compulsively and \u0026ldquo;working the room\u0026rdquo; to get something out of attendants. Personally, I prefer to think of what you do at a conference in terms of building meaningful connections with like-minded people over time. One good metaphor for this is your particular scientific community as a neighbourhood: when you arrive to a new neighbourhood, you go up and talk to your neighbours, and try to establish a positive relationship with them. This is not because you need a cup of salt from them right now, but rather because you will cross paths frequently in the future, and having a good relationship with them is likely to have countless benefits in the long term (and it just feels nice). Some tips to start establishing these ties with your academic neighbours:\n Don\u0026rsquo;t just hang out with people from your lab, institution or who you know well. Obvious, as you are trying to make new connections \u0026ndash; but I fall for the safety of familiar people all the time. Don\u0026rsquo;t ditch hard-earned friendships for trying to meet random strangers either. Try to strike a balance. One way to help you with that is\u0026hellip; Putting people in contact with each other (\u0026ldquo;your work reminds me of that of my friend X, let me put you two in contact\u0026rdquo;) helps you combine and expand your existing clique with newcomers. Besides, you are doing them a favour, which they are likely to be grateful for. Make the goal to have good conversations (quality), not meet or exchange cards with N people (quantity). You can also prepare some conversations in advance, by looking at the program and emailing in advance people you think will be at the event, who you would love to talk with. If you are respectful of their time and explain clearly and concisely why such conversation may help you (or both of you), they may be more than happy to chat with you (or at least, be less surprised if you ambush them during a coffee break). Approach people adequately (in unstructured interaction spaces such as food queues or coffee breaks). Do not interrupt two-people conversations, go for slightly larger groups. Who to approach? Take some time to really look at people, and talk to whomever seems more open and relaxed (not to people that look rushed or stressed out). You can also approach session chairs/moderators (rather than speakers), to ask them for recommendations on where to go or who to talk to. They often know well the community but are not as demanded as speakers or keynotes after their talk. Small talk is important to overcome the initial awkwardness of talking with a stranger. Yet, do not just talk about weather: make the small talk work as a first step towards more meaningful connection. Since the other person is also a researcher, there are some failsafe questions and conversation starters: the other person\u0026rsquo;s personal story (\u0026ldquo;where are you from originally, and how/why did you end up in university of X?\u0026rdquo;), their current work (\u0026ldquo;what are you working on right now?\u0026rdquo;), or just talking about the papers and presentations (\u0026ldquo;what is the most exciting presentation you\u0026rsquo;ve heard so far?\u0026rdquo;). You can also \u0026ldquo;geek out\u0026rdquo; about transversal research processes like writing or taking notes on readings (\u0026ldquo;what tool do you use to take your notes and keep them organized?\u0026rdquo;). Bonus tip: if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand something in an ongoing conversation, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to look ignorant and just ask about that \u0026ndash; academics normally love to explain stuff around their topic.  Don\u0026rsquo;t let all these tips and rules intimidate you, just keep in mind that the other people are human beings, and approach the social moments from a stance of generosity, not greed (as Tim Ferriss puts it, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t be a dick, don\u0026rsquo;t dismiss people, don\u0026rsquo;t rush\u0026rdquo;). Offer to help people out (be it with those headache pills you keep in your purse, or making a connection to someone you know) and you might find yourself unwittingly at the centre of a large social network. Indeed, some of the most compassionate people I know in my community are authentic, albeit involuntary, networking machines!\nListen: getting the pulse of your field Aside from the networking bits, going to talks and keynotes will represent most of your time at a conference. To make the most of those:\n Naturally, you should go to talks that seem to be fully in your same sub-area/topic (that was probably the whole point of going to this conference). However, if you have to choose between two less-related areas, maybe choosing on the basis of the author list/bios, rather than the title, may not be a bad idea (e.g., are there key researchers which you have read or cited?). See also the tips above about getting recommendations from other researchers, to help you decide where to go. Take notes from the talks. This is a very personal thing, but I like to take brief written notes about the talks, as a way of keeping my attention there and avoiding the lure of doing email while half-listening to a talk. I often prefer to do it on paper, in a semi-graphical format (but a plain text file works almost equally well). Also, I like to follow a simple, fixed structure for my talks notes: what\u0026rsquo;s the problem the authors set out to solve, what is the proposed solution, approach or contribution, what kind of evidence they have that it works, and what did I find interesting about the paper (not very different from the NABC research pitch I have written about before). Even if papers do not follow such structure, precisely looking for that information among the wades of slides keeps my brain active enough \u0026ndash; and signals presentation failures (or potential questions) if I fail to fill in such structure.  Present your work Even more stressful than all of the above, is delivering your own talk. How to give a good academic presentation is a thorny topic that has been covered extensively elsewhere (see here and here for some starting points), so I will not go into much detail now. Some very basic tips, though:\n Prepare your presentation in advance (i.e., before you land). This will free your mind to focus on the conference itself and all the exciting things mentioned above, rather than rushedly trying to finish your slides. I have done that a few times myself, and I always regretted it afterwards. Rehearse. For real. Several times, with an audience if you can get some colleagues or friends to hear it. Preferably do this in your lab before the trip, as you will have plenty of feedback from actual researchers, and plenty of time to polish imperfections. Pay special attention to the timing (see next point). Be concise and clear. No one wants the tiny details of your paper written in small print in your slides. Rather, focus on making the main takeaway points of your paper crystal clear. Aim at presenting in 1-2 minutes less than the allotted time (after discounting the time for Q\u0026amp;A). Have \u0026ldquo;optional slides\u0026rdquo; in case unexpected events cut your talk shorter (or you take unexpectedly long to present) \u0026ndash; the opposite very seldom happens. All those missing details are an excellent target for the Q\u0026amp;A round after your talk, and you can keep them in a batch of \u0026ldquo;backup slides\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; but let the audience ask for them explicitly. Aside from your talk slot at the conference, be prepared to pitch your research informally. You will have many opportunities: coffee breaks, buffet lines, that surprise conversation with a famous professor\u0026hellip; I have covered how to structure a brief pitch for your research in a previous post. However, it is useful to have pitches of various lengths available: the one-sentence version, the example of why it is important, or the full three-minute NABC. With those ready, read the face of your interlocutor and select the most appropriate to the context and their apparent level of boredom.  In summary Whoa, that was a lot of advice! Don\u0026rsquo;t try to memorize all of that. Many of these things you will forget to do, but you can try some and see what works for you. Develop your own set of routines over time as you go to more conferences. If nothing else, you can just try to abide by three basic principles:\n Do not \u0026ldquo;network\u0026rdquo;, build meaningful connections with fellow researchers. Think more of how you can help them, rather than getting something you crave out of the interaction. Your work is a gift for the community, not a stick to measure you. When presenting and pitching your work, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid. The knowledge base of your community is like a house under construction. Your work is a uniquely-shaped brick that you have painstakingly baked to contribute to that complex building. The conference is just a great place to show the brick to others, ask around, and try to find out where it fits. No one is judging you (and most of them are thinking about their own bricks anyways). Follow your curiosity and just enjoy these few days of opening your mind to new ideas and perspectives.  The bags are packed, the post is almost finished, so I\u0026rsquo;ll head to the train station and the airport. I can feel now the excitement and expectation of being exposed to new ideas, of meeting some old friends and making new ones. I also remember my nerves as I prepared to go to my first international conference (which, I now realize, was exactly ten years ago, going to the very same CSCL conference in Rhodes!).\nDid you find any of these tricks and practices surprising or useful? Do you have any other tricks you use when going to scientific conferences? Let me know in the comments below. Also, if you happen to be going to the CSCL conference, feel free to drop me a line or just walk up for a chat in one of the coffee breaks, I like to hear from my readers :)\n I\u0026rsquo;d love to give more scientific, evidence-backed advice, but I have not found any empirical studies on the relative success of different kinds of practices in academic conferences. Maybe a new field of research on academic event practices is waiting for somebody to start it? And if you know about any such research, please send it my way!\r[return] Plus, if you missed a potentially interesting parallel session, find someone that went there and ask them about it (voilà! you just got a ready-made conversation starter, see more on that below).\r[return]  ","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/posts/going-to-conferences/","tags":["Conference","Presenting","Research","Networking"],"title":"Tips for attending scientific conferences"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"A shorter post this week, to warn you about a small hiatus in the blog (due to taking a \u0026ldquo;disconnected break\u0026rdquo;), and to propose a new post format: Monday Mantras. As the first exercise in this format, I propose you use the best shortest productivity advice I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read.\nAs I write these lines, my bed is littered with the contents of the backpack I will use in a long hiking trip through the North of Spain. This trip is not only a holiday, but also a \u0026ldquo;disconnected break\u0026rdquo;1. So\u0026hellip; you may not see a post here for the next two or three weeks. Sorry!\nThis week, as the academic year nears its end (read, lots of course grading), I did not have too much time to read or write for the blog. Thus, it is the perfect time to try out a new kind of post that I\u0026rsquo;ve been pondering about for several weeks now: the Monday Mantra.\nWhat is a \u0026ldquo;Monday Mantra\u0026rdquo;? A mantra is a short utterance, word or sentence, believed to have psychological or spiritual powers. They originated in ancient India (using Sanskrit language), and are used in many Asian spiritual traditions like Hinduism or Buddhism and many others. In modern times in the West, you can find a similar concept in short sayings, maxims, slogans, principles or heuristics. The \u0026ldquo;home sweet home\u0026rdquo; signs people hang in their living rooms, or motivational posters people put in their offices, all fall into this broad category. They often are abstract enough to apply and be useful in many different situations, as long as we remember them (which is why people hang them in visible places, as reminders).\nThe Monday Mantra is a simple, practical exercise that builds upon this category of short but useful reminders:\n On a Sunday like today, in the daily review and preparation for your next day (mentioned in a previous post), pick up an index card, big post-it or other pocket-sized piece of paper. Write the mantra on the card, in easily-visible writing. Put the card somewhere, making sure that you will see it when you get up (e.g., in your nightstand). On Monday morning (hence the name), when you get up, take a look at it, and maybe stop for 1-2 mins while you get your bearings. Think how it can be applied today. You can also take the card in your pocket for the whole day, looking at it at random times when you surprise yourself taking it out of your pocket. Or you can put copies of it in different places as reminders, in your office desk or any other place where you work frequently. The point is to be reminded daily of it, to see if its wisdom helps you change your behavior in a positive way. Repeat the previous step also on Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. as you get up and go on with your days. Take 1-2 weeks doing this, until it becomes second nature to apply it. That\u0026rsquo;s it. If you journal (something I also recommend), you can reflect at the end of the day if you applied the mantra, whether it worked, and how did it feel.  These week\u0026rsquo;s Monday Mantra: the best shortest productivity advice As a first example for you to try, I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen this ingenious 11-word pithy advice on productivity, which I first encountered in a well-known productivity website:\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe best shortest productivity advice I ever encountered\n\r\r\rIts simplicity is deceiving \u0026ndash; the hard part is remembering to apply it. This few sentences summarize a lot of productivity advice I\u0026rsquo;ve read from many sources, from productivity systems to time management gurus and other generally busy but successful people. It goes to the heart of many Ph.D. students (and my own) effectiveness problems: procrastination, multi-tasking, dispersion of efforts\u0026hellip; A funny retelling of similar time management principles, in comic strip form, can be found here (kudos to Adolfo for pointing this one out to me).\nI really encourage you give Monday Mantras a try, and see if it makes a difference in your productivity. If you tried it, please please please please let me know how it went in the comments below. In general I\u0026rsquo;d love any feedback on this new, shorter advice/post format and the exercise itself.\n Not too different from the now-trendy \u0026ldquo;digital detox\u0026rdquo;: a period in which you drop most of your digital consumption and media use. There is still not a lot of scientific evidence on its effects, but there are preliminary studies showing that this kind of disconnection from continuous online exposure (mostly through our phones) may help lower your stress.\r[return]  ","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/posts/monday-mantra-1/","tags":["Productivity","Mantra"],"title":"A small hiatus, and a Monday Mantra"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":" As a Ph.D. student, you very often have to present what your research is about. Maybe you want to get quick feedback from a visiting professor. Or you need to give a talk at a conference or doctoral consortium. In this post, I go over a technique adapted from a large US research lab I once visited. I will walk you through its simple four- (or five-)part structure, including real examples from my own work. Don\u0026rsquo;t be fooled by its simplicity\u0026hellip; simplicity is actually its main strength!\nAs the summer gets close, many of my Ph.D. students (and I as well) get ready to go to conferences, or workshops, or visit other labs. In all those situations, there will come a moment that I personally dreaded for a long time: when somebody asks you \u0026ldquo;what is your research/paper/thesis about?\u0026rdquo;. Very often, this happens semi-informally, and you may not have slides to support you. Thus, it is more akin to the classic \u0026ldquo;elevator pitch\u0026rdquo;, so common in the business and start-up world.\nSo, how do you do an elevator pitch of your research? How to summarize months, maybe years of work in a few sentences, but still impress, or pique the curiosity of your improvised audience? In the rest of this post, I will share a simple technique I learned years ago, when I failed at doing precisely that.\nAbout 9 years ago, around the middle of my Ph.D., I was doing a three-month research stay at SRI International, a large research institute based in California, which does research on anything from military stuff to education. I was having a nice lunch break with some of the wonderful people I was collaborating with, in the sunny terrace of one of their cafeterias. Then, an older guy comes into our table and asks whether he can sit in with us. Sure enough, we said. I quickly learned that this was Curtis Carlson, then CEO of the institute. A few minutes of conversation later, the moment I was fearing all along, actually happened: he innocently asked me, \u0026ldquo;what is your research collaboration about?\u0026rdquo;. I probably blanked out, and mumbled something about collaborative learning tools we were using with some schools. He patiently listened, and then offered a small piece of advice for situations like this: use the NABC model.\nWhat is the NABC model As described elsewhere, this simple structure originated in SRI, as a way to develop ideas for innovative projects. Its main focus is the value proposition: what is the added value of the idea for the client/customer. The model suggests that every innovative idea has to solve an important client or market need addressed by a unique approach with compelling benefits when compared against the competition or alternatives. One classic example SRI provides, from real life, goes like this:\n \u0026ldquo;I understand that you are hungry (the Need). Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the SRI Cafe (the Approach). It is close, the food is good and it is quiet there so we can continue working (the Benefits). The alternative is McDonald\u0026rsquo;s, which is noisy at lunchtime (the Competition or alternative).\u0026rdquo;\n As you can see, this definition has four elements:\n A Need: Who is the client (the target of the innovation), and what need/problem of theirs are we going to address? how big is that market or collective of people? An Approach to solve that need or problem. What is our compelling solution to that specific client need? You can often use drawings, simulations or mockups, to convey your vision. The main Benefits of using that approach to solve the need. This can be things like lower cost, better performance or quicker response. Very often these benefits need to be quantifiable and substantial. What the Competition has been doing so far, or what are other alternatives the client has (including doing nothing about the need!). Why are our benefits significantly better than these alternatives? Why is this the best value?  Simple, right? Now wait, you say. This all sounds very business-y, and it may be fine for a startup or a big commercial lab. But I am a humble Ph.D. student, and my research is more academic. How does all this apply to me?\nHow N(Q)ABC looks like for your research\u0026hellip; with examples We have already seen that not every research needs to solve an immediate need (especially, in more theoretical fields). Yet, the exercise of trying to distill in a few sentences what your research does and for whom (and why it may be a good idea), is very beneficial. If nothing else, because that is precisely what you will do for most of your research career, when you apply for funding. Plus, it may help you in connecting with other researchers, and see more meaning in your own project (which is crucial for completing your Ph.D.). How would those NABC elements translate to your humble research paper, or your PhD thesis?\n Need: what is the problem that your research tries to solve? If nothing else, a response can be \u0026ldquo;we don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about X\u0026rdquo;. Very often, especially in more applied fields, there is a societal or practical problem behind it. Do you want to cure cancer patients? Will more knowledge about the history of Italian Fascism help modern citizens understand the current rise of authoritarianism? Why is it important to know what you set out to find out? Competition: how have others solved this need so far? This often covers the \u0026ldquo;literature review\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;related work\u0026rdquo; of your research. What did previous research on the problem find out (or fail to do so)? Reduce that body of work to its essence, the gist of what people have done so far in that direction (and what shortcomings those approaches have). Question: Very often, after explaining our topic, experienced researchers will delve deeper with a \u0026ldquo;what is your research question?\u0026rdquo;. Thus, I have directly inserted it here. In most fields, a research question should guide each paper or whole Ph.D. dissertation. And, in a sense, this question is often derived from previous research (see the Competition). Thus, stating the question1 here is a perfect segway into the next parts of the model, which are more about what you do. Approach: This covers both the research methodology you are following (i.e., how you go about answering the question), and what is the solution you found out or propose, to solve the problem. You may mention here any other assumptions or hypotheses you have as well, that were not mentioned in the Question element above. Benefits: In the case of a research paper, this often refers to your results. How did your solution perform, if you evaluated it? did your treatment cure cancer, and in what kind of cases? what is the gist of what you discovered about Fascist history? If your research is still preliminary, you can mention the expected benefits of your proposal. You can also circle back to the Competition, explaining how your results compare with prior research. We are in research, not business, so we can also show a bit of critical thinking and include here one or two main limitations of your approach or our study.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe main elements of a N(Q)ABC pitch\n\r\r\rMaybe a couple of examples will better drive the point home. If you remember the journal paper that I used as an example when describing my writing method, the pitch could look like:\n Need: Teachers very often are asked to reflect about their teaching, to develop as professionals Competition: So far, teacher reflections are infrequent and based on memory (which we know is biased). Sometimes teachers manage to record videos or have observers, but that takes even more time and effort (and thus gets done even more rarely). Question: How can we use technology to help teachers gather data about, and reflect upon, their teaching in an everyday manner? Approach: We worked with a school to iteratively design technologies that let them gather simple data about the issues they care about. The result is Prolearning, a simple anonymous feedback and reflection tool. Benefits: Teachers using the tool in their real classes spent an average of 1-2 minutes per lesson in gathering data. They also mentioned thinking more often about the teaching issues they were asking feedback about. They also said they would not use it literally every day.  And here is another one, for a workshop presentation I will give at a conference this summer. This one is not a finished project, but rather one we are starting (i.e., for which we do not have lots of results yet). Please note the change in order and quality of the model\u0026rsquo;s elements:\n Need: Collaboration and collaborative learning is a very important skill. Researchers, but also teachers and students themselves need to understand how they work and learn collaboratively.\n Approach: Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) uses sensors and other sources of data to understand how collaboration happens across digital platforms and the \u0026ldquo;real world\u0026rdquo;.\n Benefits: MMLA can provide a more complete view of the collaboration process, than teachers just looking at a situation, or analyzing the traces of students using a digital platform.\n Competition: However, most MMLA is currently done in controlled lab settings, requires complex data gathering setups (e.g., a researcher being there), and its findings are often tied to a particular way of setting up sensors and other classroom elements.\n Question: Can we come up with more robust MMLA technologies that help us understand collaboration across different classrooms, and which teachers/students can use autonomously?\n  Simple, yet flexible. That is one of its main values. The other great advantage is that it allows for fast iteration of ideas, be it with your supervisors, other co-authors, or any researcher you come across in conferences and other events. Of course, it also requires a small bit of preparation and rehearsal \u0026ndash; you need to memorize your sequence of five elements. But I have found that quite easy, as they often form quite an easy-flowing story.\nOver to you I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but just doing this exercise has helped me bring some clarity to the talk I\u0026rsquo;m preparing for the summer. I can easily build a compelling and memorable presentation around this kernel. Just add a few slides with photos, graphs and a couple of keywords and\u0026hellip; voilà!\nWhat about you? Try this structure in your next conference, or with your latest paper. Pitch it to a colleague or to your supervisors. Ask them for feedback: what parts are unclear or not very compelling? Then, do tell me how it went in the comment section below.\n \u0026hellip; or a shorter, more direct version of it, since very often research questions tend to end up very convoluted, to accurately qualify what exact piece of the research space you really can explore with your limited efforts and resources as a Ph.D. student.

However, the daily grind of research life can erode that sense of excitement students have about delving into the unknown. In this post, I explore the role of curiosity in doctoral studies, and look at a few practices and tricks to keep the flame of curiosity alight (without burning the village!).\n\r\r\rCuriosity killed the cat, by beverlyislike\n\r\r\rI have been a bit depressed lately. And for no particular reason: I have a good research job, I\u0026rsquo;m working with a lot of smart people, I\u0026rsquo;m doing my tasks (without getting too overwhelmed by them). Yet, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel nearly as fun as it did in the past. For instance, during my Ph.D., I was sometimes having a blast just reading some random papers! Then it struck me.\nHow long has it been since you learned something new?\nPeople have different motives to get into a Ph.D.. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but I really enjoy learning about stuff. Understanding something that I did not understand. Finding an explanation for odd things that I observe around me (what makes some people a joy to collaborate with, and others a pain?).\nI am not alone in this: curiosity is related with our sense of autonomy as doctoral students (which is considered the most important factor in achieving and sustaining intrinsic motivation and completing the Ph.D.). And one way to support this autonomy is to enable students\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;curiosity-based explorations\u0026rdquo;. But\u0026hellip; is curiosity always good? or is it dangerous, as in\u0026ldquo;curiosity killed the cat\u0026rdquo;? Are there healthy ways to cultivate it during the Ph.D.? Let\u0026rsquo;s get the basics out of the way first.\nWhat is curiosity? In common parlance, we could define curiosity as the strong desire to learn or know something. Curious people \u0026ldquo;ask questions, manipulate interesting objects, read deeply \u0026hellip; and persist on challenging tasks\u0026rdquo;. There are multiple theories and models of curiosity: for example, some researchers have tried to measure it as a personal trait (am I a curious person in general?); others as a state (am I curious now about this?).\nThere is also a kind of ambivalence in terms of whether it is a positive or a negative thing. On the positives, curiosity activates the brain in a way that prepares it for learning and remembering (both about the object of curiosity, and unrelated stuff happening in that moment). It also has other benefits related to exploration: it gives us an increased sense of self, and protects us against the distress we feel when we try new things or step out of our comfort zone. Furthermore, there are many studies linking curiosity and wellbeing: curious people tend to report greater psychological wellbeing, have longer life spans, are more reactive to events that offer opportunities for growth, and perceive greater meaning and purpose in life. Awesome, right?\nUnfortunately, there are also downsides to it: it is known to be a fleeting emotion that very quickly disappears. It is sometimes felt as a negative emotion (e.g., seeking information out of frustration at not knowing). And, most importantly, it can become an addictive behavior, which has been linked with poor impulse control, which in turn is related with all sorts of bad things in life. Thus, it seems that curiosity can be a very nice and useful emotion\u0026hellip; in moderation.\n\r\r\rCuriosity as a remedy with some contraindications\n\r\r\rCuriosity in the Ph.D. Curiosity has always played a role in research and innovation: one can think of the many curiosity-based discoveries (as in, completely useless at the time) that afterwards had a huge impact on science and technology. Innovative organizations are known for leveraging the curiosity of their members. For instance, Google\u0026rsquo;s policy of leaving employees 20% of their time for side projects, or their 70-20-10 rule for how to distribute resources to ensure innovation (10% of resources for \u0026ldquo;blue sky\u0026rdquo; projects unrelated to the company\u0026rsquo;s core business). In areas where we need to generate new knowledge and innovate (like research), curiosity has to be sustained\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip; but also reined! As Inger Mewburn mentions in her online course \u0026ldquo;Surviving the PhD\u0026rdquo;, there is a big dark side to curiosity: information addiction. This is especially common when doing a literature review: the fear of missing out some crucial study, the urge to \u0026ldquo;just find another paper\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; we have all been there, because it is a really satisfying way to procrastinate! And, very often, we don\u0026rsquo;t even take advantage of the papers we find, since we get hooked to the search, not the actual reading. This even has a name: Obsessive Article Collecting (OAC) syndrome.\nIn short, it seems that curiosity in the Ph.D. is a remedy that comes with a lot of caveats. Students should cultivate it, but in moderation. And supervisors probably should keep an eye on this too. Can we find the tricky balance between warning students when we think the current exploration is unlikely to be productive, and blunting curiosity altogether?\nPracticing curiosity I still have not mastered this goldilocks balance of \u0026ldquo;just enough\u0026rdquo; curiosity, neither as a researcher, nor as an advisor of researchers. Yet, there are a few practices that I\u0026rsquo;ve found helpful to develop, sustain and rein curiosity:\n Have a list of curiosities and learning projects. If curiosity is the addiction to acquire new knowledge, it makes sense to separate the impulse (I realize I want to know X) from the response (I go down the Google Scholar rabbit hole for the next few days). People that are addicted to buying stuff sometimes keep a \u0026ldquo;quarantine shopping list\u0026rdquo;: when they get the idea to buy something, they commit themselves to not buy it immediately, and add it to the list. After, say, 3o days, if they still want to buy it, they buy it. However, most of the time the urge to buy recedes, they forget the object or realize they don\u0026rsquo;t really need it. Similarly, I keep a list of \u0026ldquo;things I\u0026rsquo;m curious about\u0026rdquo; and other learning projects that come to my mind. Every time I catch myself thinking \u0026ldquo;oh, I should learn more about [something]\u0026ldquo;, I commit to not follow through (unless it is really central and necessary to what I\u0026rsquo;m doing right now). Only days later, when I have a free time-slot or I want to spice up my intellectual life a little, I go back to the list and have fun learning stuff! As of this writing, my list contains more than 30 such projects, both research-related (e.g., learn more about single-case research designs) and completely random (how do cooperative companies and business models work?).1 Timebox curiosity. Maybe you noticed the word \u0026ldquo;time-slot\u0026rdquo; in the previous paragraph. During work hours, never give in to curiosity without a fixed time limit2. Rather, you can say: I will learn all I can about this during two pomodoros. Or, if you are using your calendar to avoid to-do list overwhelm, you can allocate a free 2-hour slot for it in your calendar, once all the other more important stuff has been allocated. You get the idea. Write down what you learned. Another trick to slow curiosity down without killing it, is to take some time at the end of the \u0026ldquo;curiosity timebox\u0026rdquo; to write down a few take-aways. This is especially useful in literature review frenzies: For each paper you read, jot down something in your reference manager, research journal, or wherever you organize your information. This will help fix what you read in memory, and it may save you from re-reading the paper next time you come back to it. Friday experiments. This practice I learned from my friend (and researcher) Kshitij Sharma, although I don\u0026rsquo;t know if he invented it himself. In brief, it consists on keeping your Fridays free to plan, conduct and analyze experiments or studies that are not at the center of your research. You can think of it as the academic version of Google\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;20% for side projects\u0026rdquo; policy. This works especially well if you do it collaboratively with other people in your lab or department. While this can seem idle inefficiency, it can be tremendously productive. Several of my papers on teacher eye-tracking studies have their origin in one such fun collaboration I did with Kshitij back when we were labmates in Switzerland. (For supervisors) Keep a curiosity-friendly atmosphere in the lab. The practices above are nice, but sometimes our environments do not really encourage such explorations. If a lab/department frowns upon the occasional new method or inter-disciplinary tangent, curiosity and creativity can quickly suffocate. In their advice to encourage intellectual adventurousness in doctoral research, Imperial College London recommends supervisors to create a lab culture that is structured (clear objectives, deadlines, timetables), but also safe to voice ideas; where there are no silly questions, and informal communication happens easily. Take a look at it for more ideas on how to achieve this. (For supervisors) Motivational interviews. Some researchers suggest that curiosity could be used clinically against demotivation (due to curiosity\u0026rsquo;s links with wellbeing). For instance, Kashdan \u0026amp; Silvia suggest the use of motivational interviews, in which a counselor uses empathic listening and the eliciting of self-motivating statements, to prompt people to change their behavior. This technique\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on helping people find their own reasons to do things (vs. imposing what they should be doing) seems like a good match for PhD supervisors trying to help students find their intrinsic motivation \u0026ndash; which is crucial in persisting and completing a Ph.D.3. However, this is a hypothesis, not empirically-backed advice, so take this idea with a pinch of salt!  Back to my own demotivation in recent times, I have to say that I had a blast learning about curiosity, through some \u0026ldquo;timeboxed curiosity\u0026rdquo; (I dedicated no more than four hours over three days to read about this topic). Also, I am starting to think about good ideas for \u0026ldquo;Friday experiments\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\nWhat about you? Are you \u0026ldquo;addicted to finding papers\u0026rdquo;? What curiosity-based practices do you have in your daily life? How do you keep your curiosity under control? Let me know in the comments below.\n Indeed, this very blog sprung out from one such projects. I had the curiosity to see know more about the effects of a Ph.D. on wellbeing\u0026hellip; and here we are! [return] Of course, with your free time, do as you please! [return] As anecdotal evidence backing this idea, many of the best supervisors I\u0026rsquo;ve met in my career as a researcher, do seem to be good at empathic listening and asking questions to help you find out your own reasons to do things (vs. telling you what to do right away). This was sometimes very annoying as a Ph.D. student. Now, after the doctorate ended, I appreciate the value such advising style had.

Yet, have you ever looked at your task list and felt anxious, certain that you have too much to do and too little time? In this post, I review several routines that have helped me overcome this ubiquitous feeling.\nI have been working (in the industry and in academia) for about twenty years now. Yet, periodically, I look at my to-do list, or at the list of “projects I’m doing”, and I feel my heart rate rise. The grip in my stomach, the slight trembling of the hands. There is no way I’m finishing all that. Not in my whole life.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rA typical to-do list of mine. Note the amount of undone tasks!\n\r\r\r\r\r\rMy to-do list around 2017, with the tasks grouped into projects. Note the number of projects!\n\r\r\r\rEverybody gets overwhelmed If you ever had this feeling, it turns out you are not alone. In a recent “productivity in the Ph.D.” workshop that I facilitated, the feeling of having too many tasks was selected the most pressing problem by a majority of the twenty-something doctoral students and academics participating. This pressure on work-life balance is also mentioned in many studies about doctoral anxiety and depression.\nHowever, the research on solutions to this problem seems rather scarce. Most of the advice on doctoral productivity notes that you should have a to-do list. And you should. A to-do list is a very powerful tool to capture tasks and deadlines, so that your head doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to remember. This works very well for many people in all walks of life. But, for many Ph.D. students, there comes a time when the captured tasks become too numerous (especially, if you use digital task management tools, which grow indefinitely). At this point, even choosing what to do next among those 147 items feels like an insurmountable task.\nPart of the problem is that the to-do list has become the place where everything gets thrown: from important mandatory tasks with important consequences if not done (\u0026ldquo;do my taxes\u0026rdquo;) to wishful-thinking side projects that we are not even sure we want to do (\u0026ldquo;read more about theory X\u0026rdquo;). Self-help books and \u0026ldquo;time management gurus\u0026rdquo; give more tactical advice: remove or delegate as much of it as possible; prioritize your tasks; or align them with your top priorities. And, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, that is all good advice, which I have myself followed at one time or another. By all means, read those links and do what they say. In essence, one can summarize such advice in a single idea:\nFocus.\nHowever, most of that advice is something you do once. You organize, prioritize, delegate your big to-do list\u0026hellip; and that takes you maybe a couple of hours. There is no way you can do that very often \u0026ndash; because you don\u0026rsquo;t have time to begin with!\nFinding focus and avoiding overwhelm Here are a few daily practices and routines that have helped me keep the to-do anxiety at bay. Some of them I skimmed from time management advice; others I took from fellow academics. I find they build on top of one another, and are increasingly difficult to pull off consistently. Thus, you could try them out one by one (e.g., adding a new one each week) rather than all at once.\n Level 0: The Daily Review. This is more of an enabler of the other routines, but it is critical. The idea is very simple: take 5-10 minutes every day to reflect on what happened today, review what you accomplished, and plan the next day. It is important to actually write (or type) things down, not just think about it. Check off the tasks you did, and write a few sentences of journaling (what interesting events happened, what was my mood, feelings, or lessons learned1). The Daily Review works best if you do it at the same time every day, maybe as a part of your daily \u0026ldquo;winding down from work\u0026rdquo; routine. For example, I do it as the start of my \u0026ldquo;go to bed\u0026rdquo; process, followed by brushing my teeth, and reading for a while. This offloads my worries and plans to a piece of paper: my brain knows that the important stuff has been taken care of. I rarely have trouble sleeping now, since I started being consistent with this routine. Level 1: Today\u0026rsquo;s To-do. During the Daily Review, after the short reflection on what happened today, take a look into the next day: what appointments you have in your calendar, what errands or urgent things are coming up. Visualize the \u0026ldquo;plan of attack\u0026rdquo; of how are you going to make tomorrow a great day. Then, create a separate, small to-do list with the things that you think you can do tomorrow. Just tomorrow. This list should fit into a post-it, and this is what you should keep in your pocket, in front of you at all times. The other, big to-do list, you will only look at during review time (or when adding new tasks that come up). Level 2: MITs. If you are like me, even the small \u0026ldquo;Today\u0026rsquo;s To-do\u0026rdquo; list is still an over-optimistic chimera, a fantastic expectation I usually fail to fulfill. In my daily reviews, I saw repeatedly 30-60% of the tasks for the day go unfinished. And the harder, long-term important tasks were often the ones left behind. Crucial projects got stuck in my task queue for weeks. Can you smell the aroma of procrastination? Enter the Most Important Tasks (or MITs) of the day2. Ask yourself: among the list of today\u0026rsquo;s tasks, is there 1-3 of them that are vastly more important than the others? something that advances your long-term priorities, even if it is not urgent today? or something that really needs to get done tomorrow, that no one else can do? Then, transform you plain to-do for the day to a simpler list of these 1-3 MITs. Add the appointments (\u0026ldquo;6pm - go to the doctor\u0026rdquo;). The rest, you can put somewhere less visible (like the back of the post-it). Think of them as optional things that you will do once the MITs have been accomplished. Level 3: Ditch the to-do list. Yes, you read correctly. You just stop using a to-do list altogether. But wait, I hear you scream, how do you keep yourself organized, then?? Well, you substitute the to-do list with your calendar or diary3. When a new task comes in, you do not commit to do it unless you find an adequate free time slot for it (i.e., one long enough to do the task). Building up on Level 2 above, you would place first the important stuff (i.e., the MITs)4, the unavoidable appointments and meetings, and only then, everything else (if there is time left). Managing your tasks like this has several benefits, the main one being realism. Time (and not the number of tasks) is the real, limited, non-renewable resource that we all have. This hack puts time in the focus of attention: do I have time to do all the things that I\u0026rsquo;d like? (often the answer is no). Then, I have to accept that I will not do some of those things (at least, tomorrow \u0026ndash; but then, on what day can I place it?). Of course, as the day goes on, your initial plans change, unexpected meetings appear, things take longer than you thought\u0026hellip; all that is normal. Just modify your calendar accordingly, and if you have to move less important tasks to another day, do it. Doing this consistently will make your productivity, triggers and temptations visible, and will act as a vaccine against our personal planning fallacies. You will become a better planner. And the Daily Review is a great time to reflect and do this kind of learning.  Simple advice, difficult to follow Reading this post, you would probably think that I have all this to-do list stuff figured out, right?\nNope.\nI am still struggling with this myself, trying to follow my own advice. For the last months I have been at Level 2 quite consistently \u0026ndash; and I learned that I rarely achieve more than two MITs, so I don\u0026rsquo;t even try. And I\u0026rsquo;m still in the process of making Level 3 work with my own daily routines (see the photos below). I still keep a sort-of \u0026ldquo;big to-do list\u0026rdquo; which I look at in review-time\u0026hellip; but I try to see it rather as \u0026ldquo;things I would like to do for which I don\u0026rsquo;t have a definite time\u0026rdquo;. I know many of those I will probably never do. Eventually, this list will also go away in favor of the zen-master simplicity of Level 3.\n\r\r\rMy implementation of routine levels 1-2-3. Note the MITs, journaling and time to do each task (under the X\u0026#39;s in the left side)\n\r\r\r\r\r\rMy calendar for one day, at review-time. Block duration has been corrected to reflect the real duration, not my plan\n\r\r\r\rWhat about you? Do you also feel this to-do list overwhelm? Have you tried any of these routines? Or do you use different tricks? In both cases, do let me know in the comments below!\n Especially, you can reflect whether you were able to do all the things that you set out to do (see the other to-do-related routines). Do you always underestimate the time tasks will take (I still do)? What derailed your plans? What were the main distractions and triggers? Can those be avoided? By writing down these things, you learn about how you plan, what makes you productive or unproductive. You will progressively become better at planning and executing what you want to accomplish. [return] I first came in contact with this idea of MITs in Leo Babauta\u0026rsquo;s Zen to done productivity system. Tim Ferriss mentions a similar principle in his productivity advice. Both are worthy reads on their own right, if you are interested in how different people organize themselves to be productive. [return] This hack was pointed out by Paul Rayson, in the productivity workshop I mentioned at the beginning of the post. Thanks, Paul, for the idea! [return] Pro tip: in my experience, the tasks I do first thing in the morning have more chances to be completed. As the day goes on, the chances that something unexpected will happen (including self-distraction and procrastination) multiply. Plus, I tend to have more mental energy in the mornings. Hence, put your MITs first thing in the morning, if you can!

What would you like to know about doing a Ph.D., or being a (happier, more productive) PhD student?\nWhen I started this blog back in January, my goal was to learn about how to support PhD students in becoming researchers, especially around certain problems that I had seen with increasing frequency (like anxiety and depression). I also wanted to put out there ideas, tips and tricks that I thought could be useful for others, both from my own experience and everyday practice, and from research studies I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading on these issues.\nAlmost four months and eleven posts later, I hope some of you found some of these ideas useful\u0026hellip; but I cannot help but wonder whether I am focusing on the right topics, on the problems that actually bother you every day as you try to learn the ropes of research.\nNow there seems to be about 200 of us reading this blog (maybe around 50 reading regularly), so let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can make it even more useful to each of you: What are your main obstacles to progress and productivity? What do you see currently as the biggest threats to your wellbeing? what things about this whole research business still puzzle you? what did nobody teach you, that seems crucial now in your everyday researcher life? Let me know in the form below, until May 2nd!\nIf I can give you ideas about how I (or others I know) do any of that, I will. And if there is research on any of those issues, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to find it and bring it on.\nNB: Of course, you can also put your ideas here if you are a supervisor, but try to think them from a student\u0026rsquo;s perspective (what bothered or puzzled you when you were a PhD student?).\nLoading... Update: Poll results After closing the poll, I counted about one response to the question of what topics the readers of the blog would like to see covered. Thanks a lot, dear suggester! (if you are reading this, you know who you are).\nThis was by itself a quite interesting finding. It made me reflect on how busy everybody is these days (especially in this blog\u0026rsquo;s target demographic), and makes me rethink things like the length and style of the posts: probably people would find them more useful if they were shorter and more direct.\nFinally, in case you\u0026rsquo;re interested, 100% of the suggestions focused on a very interesting topic: how to talk with your supervisor about the issue of (doctoral student) autonomy? We already saw that this sense of being in control of your own direction is quite crucial to persist in the Ph.D.. Then, what to do if you find that your supervisor is micro-managing exactly how the research needs to be done, how the research questions should be worded, etc.?\nBeing now on the other side of the table, I totally understand the supervisor urge to \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; the work or direction of my students (especially when you see they are going in a direction that will prove unproductive, or using methods that will not be acceptable for your scientific community). But sometimes we can go too far and just impose our style of doing things on our students (which is not the goal of a doctorate, in many fields). I am not aware of research particularly around this issue, but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to dig around and I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to you if I find any useful tips or techniques. For now, maybe the only piece of advice I could give is: try to find out if the directions given by the supervisor are really about unacceptable practices, or rather are \u0026ldquo;a matter of taste\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; and try to (politely) point this out, if it is the latter.\n","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/posts/ask-happy-phd-student/","tags":["Ask me","Feedback"],"title":"Ask A Happy Ph.D. - Student edition"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"In last week\u0026rsquo;s post, we established that dropping out of a Ph.D. (or thinking about it) is surprisingly common, and we saw demographic and socio-economic factors that seem related to doctoral attrition. In this post, I dive into another strand of research that relates doctoral dropout with a general theory of human motivation: self-determination theory. This research helps explain why you may persist and finish your doctorate (and even have fun doing it), despite having such socio-economic factors playing against you. Or vice-versa. The post also gleans practical advice from the literature on doctoral attrition, in the hope of helping students and supervisors avoid this common pitfall.\nLast week, I left you with a surprising realization of mine: despite having several of the most common factors of doctoral attrition against me, I finished my Ph.D., and actually enjoyed most of that trip. How come?\nThere is one thing I noticed in many of the studies I mentioned last week: studies asking to students about dropping out often mention the importance of supervision style (or the relationship with the supervisor); and studies asking supervsiors often highlighted whether students are prepared (or, in a sense, \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo;) to face the hardships of a Ph.D. Even if nobody in these studies is directly saying: \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s the other side\u0026rsquo;s fault\u0026rdquo;, it gave a bit the impression of a certain \u0026ldquo;us vs. them\u0026rdquo; mentality, a sort of blame game.\nWhose fault is it, then? students or supervisors? The answer probably is \u0026ldquo;it depends\u0026rdquo;, but I have now come to believe that this is a false dichotomy. The point is not whose fault it is, but rather what elements have to be there for a student to engage in the research work, persist, and eventually finish the Ph.D.\nA way out of the blame game? Self-determination theory As I was reading for last week\u0026rsquo;s post, I found another big group of recent studies, which looked at the problem from a different perspective: self-determination theory (SDT). SDT is a general theory of human motivation that proposes that all human beings have a need to be competent, autonomous and related to others1. The idea is that people feel intrinsically motivated and satisfied when doing an activity that meets these needs \u0026ndash; and feel \u0026ldquo;controlled\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;amotivated\u0026rdquo; when the activity does not. Hence, these studies look at the problem of students dropping out in the sense of how the Ph.D. process and their environments meet (or fail to cater for) these needs \u0026ndash; something that is not the sole responsibility of the student, nor the advisor, but rather the interplay between both2. How does this theory of motivation help explain doctoral dropout and persistence?\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rBasic idea of self-determination theory\n\r\r\rInsights from SDT studies of doctoral dropout It is worth noting that many of these studies had smaller sample sizes, and often were more qualitative, asking about people\u0026rsquo;s feelings and motivations. Thus, they may not be directly generalizable to you or your particular situation. Still, they unearthed several interesting insights and themes:\n Feeling competent and the \u0026ldquo;impostor syndrome\u0026rdquo;. One of the themes that has appeared most often in relation to people dropping out or succeeding in the Ph.D., is how competent students felt (about doing research in general, and the different skills the doctorate entails). It appears under different names: \u0026ldquo;perceived competence\u0026rdquo;3, \u0026ldquo;self-efficacy\u0026rdquo;4\u0026hellip; or their negative flip side, the \u0026ldquo;impostor syndrome\u0026ldquo;2. Basically, it seems that a lot of student success and persistence hinges on finding ways to shake off this (totally inaccurate) impression that everyone else \u0026ldquo;gets it\u0026rdquo; and knows how to do stuff \u0026ndash; except you. A Ph.D. involves a lot of new skills and knowledge (from writing in a totally different style, to reading information and critically assessing it, being systematic and methodical, being able to abstract and synthesize, or particular technical skills). Thus, if you (and your advisors) manage to find ways of progressively developing those skills, practicing and practicing, first in smaller/easier projects and then increasing difficulty and responsibility, normalizing failure and learning from it, and highlighting and recognizing successes, you will in the end feel that you know how to do stuff (not everything, and not equally well, but much more than at the beginning), and you will believe that you could learn other things if you need it (which is true). When you have this continuous feeling of being \u0026ldquo;competent enough\u0026rdquo;, persisting and finally closing the Ph.D. seems to be much easier. A sense of progress. This theme goes hand in hand with competence as well. What do we use to determine if we are (or we feel) competent? Feedback. A rejected paper, an interested audience when you speak at a conference, looking at the data and finding that your hypothesis was confirmed, or finding that there is some error in the data and you need to repeat the experiment\u0026hellip; all those are forms of feedback that shape our perception of how competent we are, and whether we are reaching our goal of finishing the Ph.D. The problem is, many of the processes involved in a Ph.D. (like preparing and running and experiment, and then analyzing the data and getting some results; writing and publishing a paper; etc.) are very long, and the scarcity of feedback can breed an insidious sense of uncertainty. Am I closer to the Ph.D. now than two months ago? Because, our fears argue, if I\u0026rsquo;m not advancing, I might as well quit and spend my time on something else. The vagueness of criteria for obtaining a Ph.D. does not help either (what counts as a \u0026ldquo;substantial scientific contribution\u0026rdquo;?). Thus, some studies have found that having a feeling of progress, of advancing, is essential to persist in the Ph.D.5. This study also suggests that we tend to evaluate progress on a daily basis (\u0026ldquo;did I do something useful today?\u0026rdquo;). How to make this progress visible on an everyday basis is a thorny issue for which I have not seen a good, general solution. However, knowing that this is important, you can try to make your progress more tangible in every project or long-term task (see, for example, the paper writing process I propose, which emphasizes more frequent feedback from co-authors and editors than many people normally use). I will dedicate an entire post to dig deeper into this fostering of an everyday sense of progress. Similarly, finding whether students are feeling \u0026ldquo;blocked\u0026rdquo; in their progress for a long time, and seeing if something can be done to help them unblock themselves, seems a worthy goal for doctoral supervisors 6. Not too much distress. This one is quite obvious, but still worth pointing out: no matter how competent you feel, how much self-discipline you have, or how much progress you make, if doing your Ph.D. only brings you negative emotions, if it continuously feels like a burden, that it is full of problems (be them research-related, economic or personal, or psychological)\u0026hellip; it is only a matter of time for you to consider quitting. It basically goes against our sense of autonomy to do something that feels bad, again and again. Some of these studies found that, even if everyone experienced bad episodes at one point or another, doctoral students that completed the Ph.D. had experienced less negative emotions and that those were counter-balanced with positive ones5. Thus, we should not neglect our daily, \u0026ldquo;experiencing self\u0026rdquo;7: if getting up in the morning feels like a drag, if the idea of doing research or meeting your advisors fills you with anxiety, pay attention. Why is that? Talk it over with colleagues, friends, family (because you are not alone8). And conversely, do not ignore the little triumphs, the activities or parts of your day when you feel exhilarated, curious, in \u0026ldquo;the zone\u0026rdquo;. In a later post I will dive into some of this research on how to be non-judgmentally aware of the negative moments, and to emphasize or savour the positive emotions we all have in our everyday research life. Social support. Similar to what we saw when talking about anxiety and depression, it seems that strong social ties may help you complete the Ph.D.. Not only is loneliness linked to doctoral attrition2; this need for social support to endure hard times may also explain the emphasis that many of the studies on attrition make on the quality of the student-advisor relationship. After all, for many Ph.D. students, the supervisor is the only person they interact with in relation to their doctoral research. Hence, if bad times come and no support is given from the main staple of socialization (or worse, if the advisor relationship is actively disruptive), a doctoral project can go south quickly. And this may also be the reason why the presence of additional social support factors, like the positive departmental and scientific community interactions or integration practices, seem protective against doctoral attrition9,10. Probably it is a good idea to seek (and point out to your students, if you are an advisor) these additional situations and people that can provide useful research-related feedback and support: summer schools, doctoral consortia, local Ph.D. support groups\u0026hellip; all can help students realize that their problems are not unique, that difficulties do not mean necessarily that there is something wrong with them or their project. Both students and supervisors should take care of the student-supervisor relationship. Don\u0026rsquo;t let it go sour! A project that makes sense. Having a sense of purpose, being able to work on a project that makes sense to you (versus having no clear research project or being forced to work in a direction that does not make sense to you) also appeared as differential between students that completed or dropped out of the Ph.D.5. This can take many forms: having an idea of \u0026ldquo;where you\u0026rsquo;re going\u0026rdquo; with your doctoral research, and having some sort of plan (even if it is a vague one at the beginning, or it changes later on)11. Again, this goes with the need for autonomy: the project has to make sense to you (no matter how much sense your advisors see in it). If you don\u0026rsquo;t feel a sense of ownership, that this is your project, then it is less likely that you will plough through the hard times to complete it. This \u0026ldquo;making sense\u0026rdquo; can also manifest in whether you associate the research, your project, with feelings of interest, curiosity, and pleasure. Another way to find purpose in your project is if you perceive that it is useful (for you, or for others, or for the advancement of human knowledge). This overall theme has direct applications for supervisors: forcing a student to take a direction without checking whether it \u0026ldquo;makes sense\u0026rdquo; or feels interesting or useful for the student, can have dire consequences. And, from the student perspective, similar advice can be given: if you find that, for a long time, the whole idea and direction of the research do not make sense to you, speak with your supervisor, and with other fellow researchers, about that. I cannot stress the importance of this sense-making enough: it is very, very important, as SDT researchers talk about autonomy as the \u0026ldquo;linchpin of motivation\u0026rdquo;2, meaning: no matter if you get social support and you feel competent \u0026ndash; if your research does not make sense to you, if it does not feel like \u0026ldquo;your baby\u0026rdquo;, engagement with your Ph.D. will likely falter. Ignore this feeling of absurdity at your own peril!  Practical advice from the attrition literature All this research and abstract notions of \u0026ldquo;social support\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;competence\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;progress\u0026rdquo; are very nice but\u0026hellip; does any of these studies actually tell us what exactly we should do (as students, or as advisors)? are there any practices or actions that have been shown to work consistently to help students persist in their Ph.D.?\nIt seems that the research about practices and interventions to avoid doctoral attrition is not as developed as other areas of the problem. The research on SDT and attrition does have some general advice, based on what they call \u0026ldquo;basic needs theory\u0026rdquo; (BNT): basically, the idea that, to be intrinsically motivated and engaged in an activity, the environment should provide certain particular types of support to the three SDT needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness). Thus, based on BNT, some researchers propose12,13:\n To support competence, the environment has to provide some forms of structure: defining clear objectives, providing constructive feedback or advice on technical skills or planning out the students\u0026rsquo; career, and having space for discussions about the difficulties being faced by the student at the moment, and potential solutions. To support relatedness, researchers suggest to foster the advisor (and other actor\u0026rsquo;s) involvement: having a warm, respectful relationship when talking about research, reassuring the student when needed, and being concerned about the student not only as a researcher, but also as an individual human being. Finally, to support *autonomy* (which, let\u0026rsquo;s remember, was the most important of the three), the environment can help mainly by providing choice and enabling curiosity-based explorations. This includes giving students freedom in how they carry their work (e.g., work schedules or tooling), asking for their opinion about the direction of the research, encouraging them to work independently, or avoiding situations in which students are directed strongly, or under a lot of pressure (including not only psychological pressure, but also economic pressure, or even incentives, as they are known to damage intrinsic motivation sometimes)13.  \r\r\rSupporting doctoral completion with advice from Basic Needs Theory\n\r\r\rAside from such general advice, the research looking at dropouts from the point of view of SDT also includes other ideas for improving attrition rates, although their effectiveness is rather conjectural (i.e., not many are empirically tested). I have seen mentions to practices such as: journaling (as it is known to boost our \u0026ldquo;inner locus of control\u0026rdquo;, which may help with impostor syndrome), some forms of group therapy (e.g., in some universities Ph.D. students have some kind of peer support groups), or even cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)2. Other authors take a different kind of approach and suggest smaller cohorts, tougher or more detailed selection processes or probation periods, to try to get at candidates that have higher chances of completing the Ph.D.\nSo, what will you choose? Coming back to the initially not-so-great chances of completing my Ph.D. when I first started it, does this research based on SDT help explain why I finished the process successfully, and actually enjoyed most of it?14 I think it does.\nAs I mentioned, back when I started the Ph.D., I was single, the career prospects after the Ph.D. were unclear15, my academic credentials were not outstanding, and I had no funding or scholarship to fund my Ph.D. However, the good news was that I had a strong social network of friends and family (who were always supportive of my decision to pursue a Ph.D.), and I had been saving money so that I could support myself during this period. Furthermore, I had the luck to get great supervisors. That alone helped tremendously. Some of the things I think they/we did correctly, in light of what I have now discovered about SDT, include:\n My Ph.D. project\u0026rsquo;s direction was quite open at the beginning, which enabled curiosity-based explorations as I started getting familiar with the literature in my research field. Of course, some hints were given here and there by my advisors, but I did not have the impression of my direction being \u0026ldquo;externally controlled\u0026rdquo;. I was included in an ongoing, relatively small research project in which I collaborated with Ph.D. students from other fields, and in which we had liberty to decide how to do things, a certain degree of responsibility \u0026ndash; but it also was a project stakes in case of failure were relatively low. The aforementioned low-stakes project/collaboration consisted mainly of a long field study in a school (including a lot of classroom observation). This gave me a first-hand experience with the setting and people that my research should be benefitting, and made me aware of problems that my research contribution (still undefined at the beginning) could try to solve. This was invaluable later on to feel that my project \u0026ldquo;made sense\u0026rdquo;, and that it could be useful to somebody. My advisors put a lot of emphasis on planning and making sense of the Ph.D. research direction, through iterative plans for next steps and future studies, and the use of the CQOCE diagram as a kind of \u0026ldquo;compass\u0026rdquo; to understand where I was going. These diagrams and plans (of which I did twenty-odd versions during the Ph.D.), as well as the expectation of having periodic written reports about my advances, helped provide constant proof of my progress during the Ph.D. process. This feeling of progress was also reinforced by having regular meetings with my supervisors (once every two weeks, approximately). In these meetings, supervisors provided hints, ideas, constructive feedback, but never solutions or micro-managing instructions. The relationship with them was always good, and I could clearly feel that both my advisors cared about me not only as a human resource, but also as a person. Halfway through the Ph.D. process, my advisors found a way to fund my doctoral process, by re-aligning my research slightly to also address the needs of an ongoing research project of the lab. This re-adjustment was tricky from an autonomy point of view, but we managed to integrate it conceptually within the ideas and interests I had (i.e., the project still made sense to me).  The list of positive aspects goes on, but you get the idea. I think these factors helped my being intrinsically motivated to do research, to the point that much of the hard work did not feel like a burden \u0026ndash; I was curious, and it \u0026ldquo;made sense\u0026rdquo; (for the most part). Of course, this is all in retrospect: probably back in the day I found several of these (like the lack of detailed descriptions of what I should do) confusing or irritating. In any case, I think I was extremely lucky to count with such advisors, and I recommend you think carefully and review your options before choosing a supervisor (a post on that topic will come later on).\nWhat about you? Do you think your current research environment supports your competence, autonomy and relatedness? You can try the D-N2S questionnaire12 to find out \u0026ndash; and talk with your supervisor and others if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nGive these ideas a try, and let me know how it goes in the comments section below!\n Ryan, R.

This post digs into research about doctoral attrition and completion, and what factors seem to make dropping out more likely. Do not give up!\u0026hellip; unless you really want to.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rImage by Siggy Nowak from Pixabay\n\r\r\rAbout 10 years ago, when I left my job in the telecom industry to pursue an academic Ph.D., I started pursuing my other secret dream: being a psychologist. I enrolled in an online masters program on Psychology research. However, several months into the program, it was clear that this was not going to be a piece of cake. I was behind on the readings, some of the concepts in the courses were incomprehensible to me (not surprising, since my background was in Engineering), and I had some unpleasant online interactions with my peers when seeking help about these issues. My morale started to falter, and I started wondering: should I cut my losses and focus on my other main project (the doctoral degree that I had started in parallel)? Or was it better to drop out of the Ph.D. and pursue the shorter, maybe more manageable masters degree?\nDropping out of the PhD: the problem of attrition If you ever faced this kind of thoughts, you are not alone. Not at all. In the research literature about students dropping out of doctoral programs (or \u0026ldquo;attrition\u0026rdquo;, as they call it), very often the ballpark of 40\u0026ndash;60% attrition rate is mentioned1. Imagine you are in a classroom with your peer Ph.D. students. Look to the person on your left. Look to the person on your right. According to the statistics, only one or two of you will ever finish the Ph.D.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow.\nOf course, this is just a general approximation. The numbers vary quite a bit from university to university, and across the different disciplines: in one study, students in science and technology were 50% more likely to complete their Ph.D.\u0026rsquo;s than health sciences ones, and more than twice as likely compared to doctoral students in the humanities and social sciences2. This is probably due to many social, economic and cultural factors that are quite different in each discipline (rather than the inherent difficulty of the subject). Furthermore, even getting to these numbers is quite hard, since very often the researchers running these studies (and the doctoral programs themselves) don\u0026rsquo;t have a good way to know if a student has actually dropped out, or is just unusually quiet.\nThere is also the issue of when will you drop out. Several studies mention that dropping out of a Ph.D. is more probable in the first two years1,2. This is probably due to the students coming to the doctorate with a certain image or expectation of what doing research looks like, and academic research life not living up to those expectations \u0026ndash; leading to disillusionment and dropout. To avoid this, in certain areas like biomedical research, students spend some time at the beginning of the doctorate rotating around different labs to get a better sense of what working in research looks like\u0026hellip; only sometimes this also backfires, when labs start competing fiercely for the best students, so that some labs show a \u0026ldquo;friendly façade\u0026rdquo; during rotation, and a much harsher reality once the student incorporates to the lab for real3.\nSo, it is clear now: if about half of the doctoral students actually drop out of the Ph.D., probably many more have at least considered quitting. Indeed, I\u0026rsquo;d wager that you are quite lucky if you have not thought of abandoning the Ph.D. so far.\nFactors for attrition Now that we know this is a quite common problem, what are the factors related to greater chances of dropping out (or persisting until completion)? Looking into the research on this issue, I found five factors that appear quite often4:\n Kind of funding: Where you get the money from to do your Ph.D. is one of the most studied variables in relation to doctoral students dropping out. While the details vary from country to country and from one discipline to another (which determines what options are available to you), in general having no funding is associated with the highest rates of dropout (between 2.5 and six times more likely to drop out than the other options)2. Scholarships or research assistantships seem associated with lower dropouts5. While details differ across studies, it seems that the more your money source is aligned with your Ph.D., the better (e.g., if you have a scholarship that lets you freely choose your research topic, or your salary comes from a research project fully aligned with that topic). Conversely, if you are doing your Ph.D. part-time (because you took a completely unrelated job to pay your bills, or if you took a part-time lectureship at the university), you might be setting yourself up to have a harder time finishing your doctorate6. Marital status: Interestingly, married doctoral students (or those in a long-term relationship) are much less likely to drop out of a Ph.D.5. For example, in one study in Belgium, researchers found that married students were about four times less likely to drop out than unmarried ones2. As we saw when looking at depression and anxiety, it seems that this kind of close social (and, maybe, economic) support is very helpful to persist in the long journey of the doctorate. Career prospects. Quite logically, if you think that you will easily find a job once you have the doctorate under your belt, you will be more likely to persist until completion5. And vice-versa: once you stop believing that you have good career opportunities after finishing the Ph.D, dropping out seems much more likely1. Relationship with the supervisor. Rivers of ink have been poured trying to explain the influence of supervisors, and their relationship with students, in doctoral attrition. The issue appears in most qualitative accounts of doctoral student dropouts, but so far it has been quite difficult to quantify (e.g., well-advised students also drop out sometimes3). Reviews of this area indicate that a positive student-supervisor relationship is associated with completing the Ph.D.1. But what makes a relationship positive? that\u0026rsquo;s harder to say\u0026hellip; the advisors being \u0026ldquo;available\u0026rdquo;, having frequent interactions, having a sense of cooperation, understanding, and trust. Others also mention a non-hierarchical relationship, with clear expectations, or the advisor not being over-involved in their own research agenda5. Being an advisor myself, I find some of this advice wonderfully vague, but I will dig deeper into the topic of supervision styles, in a later post. Candidate \u0026ldquo;preparedness\u0026rdquo; is another factor that pops-up quite frequently, both in the sense of prior academic achievement (e.g., whether you passed your masters with very high grades), but also in terms of other personal characteristics of the doctoral student. For instance, in one study researchers found that students that passed the masters with very high distinction were two to eight times more likely to complete the Ph.D. than students that had their masters with lower grades2. However, not every review agrees that academic achievement is a critical factor in Ph.D. attrition3. Other reviews also mention students\u0026rsquo; personal characteristics, such as their motivation to do the Ph.D. (if the motivation is high, and is about learning or personal improvement, chances of completion seem to be higher), students\u0026rsquo; time on task, not having negative personal issues, etc.5  OK, so far things seem logical. If we are alone, we are not academic over-achievers, or we have to get an unrelated job to make ends meet, we will generally have a harder time during the dissertation \u0026ndash; and more chances of being faced with the dilemma of abandoning it.\nBut\u0026hellip; what is the right answer?\nA contrarian view of Ph.D. dropout Most of the research I\u0026rsquo;ve seen around this topic describes dropping out as a big problem, a waste of time and resources for everyone involved (students, supervisors, universities, society). And, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I totally see how it is a problem that should not be dismissed lightly. However, I cannot help but think that we are seeing only one side of the coin: that of the institutional success, and the student as a human resource. We could also be a bit more empathetic and look at students as a human beings, and their experience: what if dropping out is the better option for this particular student, as a person, at this point in time? In one paper, a doctoral student explains:\n ‘‘I discussed withdrawing with family and my significant other; they just wanted me to be happy and, given the treatment that I received [from my advisor] for months, it seemed like the clear choice’’3\n The quote reads like a really well thought-out, meditated decision, after enduring a toxic situation \u0026ndash; regardless of the resources \u0026ldquo;wasted\u0026rdquo;.\nPlus, are they really wasted? We may be forgetting that, even if you do not have a paper calling you \u0026ldquo;Ph.D.\u0026rdquo;, it is quite probable that you learned a few useful things during this journey, however incomplete: you learned to read scientific papers, you learned how your kind of research is really made, you learned to write and to argue a bit better, and probably you also practiced your critical thinking (which seems in short supply these days). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call that a total waste.\nSo yes, you should consider carefully before starting a Ph.D. (or accepting to supervise one). But, if the decision was made in good faith, forget about the funding, forget about the time \u0026ldquo;wasted\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; they are sunk costs7. Rather, ask yourself: am I (or is this person) going to be an effective, convinced, purposeful researcher, if I continue my doctoral training under these conditions and in this place? If the answer is no, then maybe quitting isn\u0026rsquo;t a such bad idea. Heck, there is even research that suggests that, if you are at the point where you could decide by tossing a coin, you would be better off making the change right away! 8\nIf you are facing this conundrum, evaluate your environment and your daily experience carefully, and talk about it with family and close friends. But the decision is only yours. Yet, I can give you a general rule of thumb, from what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the academic world so far: if you think you are not \u0026ldquo;smart enough\u0026rdquo;, or you have any other argument for why you will never succeed at this that smells even remotely of impostor syndrome, I\u0026rsquo;d say you can make it (believe me, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some really un-smart people get doctorates). If, on the other hand, your lab environment is toxic, your economic or social situation is really bad, or you feel deeply unhappy every day you do research, maybe it is time for a re-evaluation.\nYou can do it, if you want to endure (or -gasp!- enjoy) the process.\nComing back to my own personal case, I did drop out of the Psychology masters, to focus on my Ph.D. And I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it one bit. Indeed, even after focusing my attention on the Ph.D., a researcher could have told me that my chances were still not terribly optimistic: I was single, I was completely self-funded, my masters grades were not exactly glowing, and I had no idea whether the doctorate would bring me incredible job opportunities.\nOddly enough, not only I managed to finish my Ph.D.; I actually consider that year one of the happiest, most fulfilling of my life.\nAm I an outlier? Maybe yes. Was I extremely lucky? Probably so. However, in some of the latest readings I did for this post, I found an alternative, reasonable explanation. But this post has gotten quite long already. You will have to wait for another week to find out.\nHave you ever considered dropping out of your Ph.D.? can you think of other factors that made you stay (or abandon it)? Do you think there is a right moment to quit the doctorate? Let me know in the comments section below!\n See, for example, Bair, C. R., \u0026amp; Haworth, J. G. (2004).

To finish this mini-series of posts on writing (why writing papers is hard, how I write papers, and the second part of that writing process), I review here the main principles and lessons that I have learned after more than 10 years of writing scientific papers. I hope they help you navigate these decisions if you are in doubt, or if you have to step out of the usual writing process due to unexpected events.\nLet me start with a personal story. A story of failure, and eventual success, after a lot of hard work and harder decisions. The story of a paper I co-wrote, which took more than three years to be published. For a few months, four of us had worked at a literature review, made a conceptual framework out of it, and run some case studies to see if the whole idea made sense to others. We thought there was something there worth communicating to others. We wrote the paper with lots of outlining and feedback, we sent it to a good conference in our field, and back it came\u0026hellip; a rejection. Our paper was not convincing or clear enough, maybe tried to be too many things at the same time. One year into this side project, we seemed to be back to square one. Should we run more studies? should we rewrite the whole thing differently? should we just take it as it was and send it somewhere else? or just forget about it altogether?\nDecisions, decisions, decisions\u0026hellip; we have already established that writing is hard and, even if we have a process to guide us in this endeavor, sometimes we don\u0026rsquo;t have full control: a colleague comes with a full draft that is messy, or we have to re-do the whole paper after a peer review. In those cases, it is good to have general principles, values, heuristics to help us decide what to do. Below, I offer the most valuable lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt after more than 10 years of doing this with moderate success. Half-jokingly, I have put them in the form of Ten Commandments to follow when writing scientific papers1:\n Always think about the audience first. We often think of papers as our accomplishment, something we possess, which we \u0026ldquo;hoard\u0026rdquo; in our CV. However, it really is an act of communication, and the real success is to get somebody to read, understand and be interested in (and eventually cite and build upon) what we found out in our research. Thus, we need to find the right receivers, people like us, who may care about our findings (i.e., choose the target journal/conference carefully). And, of course, we should try to make the paper easy for the reader to get (vs. easy for us to write): provide clear structures, examples, illustrative graphs and photos, cut down unnecessary jargon, etc. Scientific writing is about getting ideas across. Along with the audience, the most important thing in any communication is the message. We should stop worrying what people will think of us by reading the paper (\u0026lsquo;do I write well enough? do I sound smart enough?\u0026rsquo;). What people will really care about is the new knowledge that we are sharing. Clarity is probably the main value in scientific writing, ambiguity is the enemy, and obscuring or making our text more vague on purpose is the biggest sin. We should be concise and simple, if things can be communicated effectively in that way: people are busy and they will appreciate getting the main point of our research in three pages rather than 30 (see the 1st Commandment). Go from core ideas to actual text (top-down approach). This may be just a personal pet peeve of mine, but I think this principle is crucial to have a sensible structure, logical coherence\u0026hellip; in short, to achieve the clarity of message required by the 2nd Commandment. We should always go through outlines and bullet-point ideas before writing a single line of draft text. If you personally prefer to start writing text directly, that\u0026rsquo;s fine\u0026hellip; but then reverse-outline your text and work on the outline: find logical gaps, repetitions of the same arguments, etc. (and be ready to throw away lots of that draft, in compliance with the 1st and 2nd Commandments). You never get it right the first time. I have never, ever, written (or seen) a first draft of a scientific paper that is published as-is in a good peer-reviewed journal. We should forget about that notion altogether. We will make mistakes, we will fail to see ambiguities, or people will misinterpret our words. And that\u0026rsquo;s OK. Breakdowns and repairs are an essential part of any communication. We need to \u0026ldquo;normalize failure\u0026rdquo; when writing, fail early and fail often, learning from our mistakes until we find the right way of communicating our ideas. That\u0026rsquo;s why I see writing as an iterative process, very much like designing any other object. We need to think of each abstract, each outline, each draft, as a prototype of the communication act we\u0026rsquo;re attempting. And, eventually, build the paper that synthesizes all that we learned about communicating those ideas. But, how can we see the faults in our own prototypes, the creations we have crafted as best as we could? Read on\u0026hellip; Feedback (from co-authors, from the scientific community) is essential to good quality writing. Every time I write a paper alone, I find that the quality of the ideas and the end result are just passable; however, once I mix other people in the process, they start seeing logical gaps, unnoticed connections to other ideas or extant research, and in the end the result is so much better. The same goes for the peer review process: even if I don\u0026rsquo;t always agree with them, reviewers\u0026rsquo; different perspectives (or misinterpretations, even) make me realize that the text was not as unambiguous as I originally thought. Of course, this is not magic: we need to choose co-authors wisely (and choose journals/conferences where we know the review process is tough but high-quality), learn from our mistakes and our good choices. And if we think of writing as something we are always learning to do better (and we should, even after we become the respected Professor), feedback is a well-known, necessary component2. There is no mastery without feedback3! Release early, release often (or \u0026ldquo;showing incomplete work is OK\u0026rdquo;). This is just an attempt to hammer down the 3rd, 4th and 5th Commandments again, by taking a well-known motto from the software development industry. If we want lots of feedback, and we wait until we have a complete paper before showing our ideas to others, it\u0026rsquo;s going to take forever to do even 2-3 rounds of feedback (if we\u0026rsquo;re lucky enough to get such patient co-authors). The only alternative if we want four, five or more rounds of feedback, is to show incomplete work. There is no way around it. We should forget our perfectionism and what our advisors/co-authors will think. Sending them an outline today is better than sending a draft next month. Besides, co-authors tend to be busy people \u0026ndash; it may be easier for them to find half an hour to read our outline this week, rather than a whole morning to read a complete draft anytime next month. Communicate effectively. As with any other collaboration, communicating clearly, politely, and respectfully goes a long way. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take people for granted, everyone in the pipeline (from our co-authors to the editors, or the reviewers) is doing this work of helping improve and publish our paper on a voluntary basis, for free (or for quite cheap). Saying \u0026ldquo;thank you\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;please\u0026rdquo;, laying out expectations clearly, meeting deadlines, being open to negotiate, etc. are more important than most people realize. Also, let\u0026rsquo;s remember that most actors in this business are more experienced than we are, and that they may have a point (even if we sometimes disagree). Learn to use a few tools to make your life easier. If writing is a craft, we need to learn the craft\u0026rsquo;s tools. Not all the tools out there, but at least the ones that we will need very often. Reference managers (lately I use Zotero), collaborative editors like Google Docs (or Overleaf if submitting to journals that use Latex), the sometimes-hated-but-ubiquitous Microsoft Word, submission systems, diagram drawing apps (e.g., Google Draw), Excel, R or whatever software we use for generating graphs\u0026hellip; all are part of the writing process at some point. We should learn to use each of those, and how they interact (can my graphing app export graphs that the submission system accepts?). There\u0026rsquo;s no need to spend too much time fiddling with them or trying new ones. But, if we find that our current toolbox gets in the way, let\u0026rsquo;s go out and find another tool that makes things easier in this and future occasions. Ask around; probably others have faced the same problem we now have. You only learn about writing by writing. Despite the emphasis on outlines, feedback and other tricks to make the writing process efficient, in the end we have to write, and write well, write clearly. And practicing a lot seems to be necessary (but not sufficient3) to be good at anything. So we should write, write, write any time we can. Write for ourselves. Love writing. Have a \u0026ldquo;craftsman mindset\u0026rdquo; about our writing4. If we find some good writing courses (scientific or otherwise), by all means we should try that too. Being skillful at clear writing is the single biggest academic and professional booster I\u0026rsquo;ve found in my life (and I\u0026rsquo;m not alone in thinking that). … (insert your own)\u0026hellip; In the end, writing is also a creative activity, and in that sense it is very personal. There is no single best way to do it that works for everyone. Once we comply with the nine Commandments above, what else is important? Find your own principles, your values, your voice, your process. And put the main idea here (or make an 11th, 12th Commandments \u0026ndash; who says they have to be 10?).  Just for the fun of it, I also tried to summarize the Ten Commandments above into two Great Principles of writing. I came up with this:\n Writing is not about you, it is about how you can help others with the new knowledge you discovered, and\n Papers are designed communication artifacts: prototype, iterate and collaborate around them!\n  I recommend you have these Commandments, these principles present every time you start writing something scientific. You could even print them out and put them somewhere visible, in the place where you do your writing:\n\r\r\rMy Ten Commandments of writing\n\r\r\rBack to the initial story of our failed paper, these principles helped us navigate the decisions during the following two years. It was obvious that our proposal was not clear enough (2nd Commandment) and a change of approach was needed. We re-did the paper entirely (4th), going from a clearer main idea for the contribution into a totally different outline (3rd). However, we still were not convinced that the new orientation was strong and clear enough. Hence, we enlisted the help of a new, fifth co-author, a very well-respected researcher in the scientific community we had as the target (1st). We sought feedback from him (5th, 7th), even before we wrote a single word of actual draft text (6th). He saw the potential of the idea, but pointed out a few flaws in our approach. We addressed those, and started writing and writing (9th). Several rounds of feedback ensued among ourselves (5th again) until we all were satisfied with the text. Of course, throughout this complex process we had to share documents, keep our references under control (especially since it was a literature review), keep track and be able to reproduce our diagrams, tables, and other artifacts (8th). We found a new target venue for our paper by politely contacting the editors (7th) of a journal which was quite interested in the field we were targeting (1st), and sent it there. Of course, revisions came from the journal (5th), and more writing had to be done (9th) to clarify, and polish, and make sure that the audience (1st) would get the message (2nd). But eventually, the paper was accepted!\nSo, get off the couch and start writing! Heed the 9th Commandment. May you have lots of success with your future papers, and let these principles guide you to a place where writing papers is actually fun. I know that place exists \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m having a drink there right now.\nDo you agree with my nine Commandments of writing? What would you pose as your \u0026ldquo;10th commandment\u0026rdquo;? Let me know in the comments below!\n Of course, you will notice many similarities between these principles and the 10-step paper writing process I outlined in previous posts.

In a previous post, I started describing in detail the process I normally follow to write my scientific papers. This post explains the rest of the process, from the outlining until you send your manuscript off to the journal/conference. One would think that this is straightforward, just scribbling and scribbling, right?\nFor those of you that did not read the previous post, I strongly recommend you go read it before reading the rest of this one. For you, and for the rest of us who just have bad memory, here is what the overall process looked like, including not only what to do in each step, but also when to get feedback from others:\n\r\r\rMy paper writing process\n\r\r\rIn steps 1\u0026ndash;5, we came up with a central idea for our paper (i.e., the contribution, the reusable knowledge that we think other researchers will be interested in). Then, we decided who our audience is (i.e., what specific community, what journal/conference would be interested), and who would be a good set of co-authors to write it with. Afterwards, we created a pseudo-abstract that summarized what is known about the paper\u0026rsquo;s topic, and what the paper brings to the scientific community and society at large. Finally, we created a \u0026ldquo;weighted outline\u0026rdquo; (a table of contents with assigned lengths for each section). You also got feedback from your co-authors a couple of times along the way, and maybe you even got the editor of the journal to signal if the paper idea would be appropriate for the journal. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s move on\u0026hellip;\nStep 6. A second, detailed outline This is just the classic, run-of-the-mill, outlining technique that many of us have been taught since high school: For every section and subsection in your weighted outline (step #5), write a series of bullet points which summarize the main points of each of your expected paragraphs. While everybody seems to know how to do this, step #6 is probably the most difficult to get right, and the one in which most writers get derailed, in my experience. Classic problems include: a) putting just a keyword in the bullet (they should be full sentences, with subject, verb, object1); or b) making the bullets multi-line paragraphs (they should be a summary, not the actual text \u0026ndash; the whole point is to compress the information that will be there once you write the text); or c) making the bullet a vague placeholder (e.g., \u0026ldquo;lessons learned from experiment\u0026rdquo; looks like something you will say over several paragraphs\u0026hellip; OK, what were the lessons? can we get the headlines, or an example?). As a general rule of thumb, your detailed outline should not be more than 20-25% of the expected length of the section/paper (i.e., if it is 5%, maybe it does not have enough detail!).\nWhen this detailed outline is finished, it is quite possible that you will have open questions, parts that you do not like at all, and your own ideas of the paper may have developed a lot by doing this exercise of putting concrete words on paper. This may be a good moment to check in again with your co-authors. You may feel this is too frequent feedback, but think that you are just sending, say, a 4-5 page document, not the full 20-page journal paper. This has two advantages: a) it is quicker to read and understand, and thus easier to fit in their busy schedules; and b) it focuses the feedback on the big ideas, the general structure (not in tiny grammar and formal details that may not be relevant anyway if the structure is modified). If things go well, you will probably get quite a bit of feedback and some useful discussions, and maybe even some changes about the overall approach of the paper. At this point, changes of direction (even large ones) are still OK \u0026ndash; remember that it does not entail ditching entire pages of hard-earned text, only a few bullet points here and there!\n You can find the detailed outline for my example paper here. You can see that my bullet points tend to be a bit complex and convoluted, almost looking like draft text. So yes, I don\u0026rsquo;t follow my own method literally, always. The really important thing here is that you are able to write it more-or-less quickly, and that it summarizes clearly (but concisely) the logical flow of ideas in the text, so that you can get quick feedback about it from your co-authors.  Step 7. Add core tables and figures This step is quite common advice when writing scientific papers. When writing the paper, do not start from the beginning till the end; rather, start from the core, the center, the results of your study. To synthesize the results, very often we resort to figures, charts, graphs, and/or tables. Sometimes, you also have some of those in the methodology, to explain the flow of events in your study, or the experiment protocol, the analysis workflow, whatever. These are very important parts of your paper, to the point that a reviewer in haste will probably just read the introduction (to get an idea of what the paper is about) and then glance through your tables and figures (to understand your main results in a bit more detail than what the abstract says)2. Hence, try to think what tables and figures your results require: what things would be too long to say in text, but would be quite clear and quick in a table or a graph? Quantitative data is an obvious choice, but also qualitative or mixed methods research can benefit from well-designed tables and figures, or photos. Add those tables and figures within your outline, wherever you think they fit within the flow of ideas. Then, if you can get your co-authors to look at them and give feedback, that would be great as well. Very often getting the figures right takes several iterations, as different sets of eyes interpret things differently, or need different amounts of labeling and clarification to understand your data or the point you try to convey.\nStep 8. A third outline with references After so many passes at the paper outlines, and four rounds of feedback with your co-authors, the ideas should be quite settled now. However, I like to insert one step more before drafting text: just add all the references needed by your paper. Probably you have been collecting and having ideas in mind about related work you could cite, and your co-authors probably have suggested some more research literature worth citing. The idea now is to be more systematic: go over each bullet point in your detailed outline, and think what references can support your ideas (or counter them!). You may find that you need to go and search some more papers about certain topics you don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about. That\u0026rsquo;s OK, take some time and search until you find what you need (or leave some placeholder like \u0026ldquo;ref needed\u0026rdquo;, if you want further input from your co-authors). Once you find the right references, add them to the relevant bullet points, using your favorite reference manager3. Once you have gone through the whole outline, you can generate the references section in seconds (that\u0026rsquo;s why you want the reference manager), and see whether your prediction for the length of the references was accurate. If not, you may need to add some, or remove non-critical references.\nAs usual, you can also send this detailed outline with references and figures to your co-authors. This version has all the elements to understand a paper and much of its quality, without the distraction of long stretches of text. Your co-authors can thus give you some ideas for references, and they can still provide feedback on the overall flow of ideas, if needed.\n You can find the detailed outline with figures and references from my example paper here. As you can see, this is already something like a paper, but without the burden of too much text. You can also notice that it is about 3,600 words long. Taking into account that our target journal\u0026rsquo;s maximum length was 6,000, by now it became clear that we probably would not be able to fit this paper into that journal\u0026rsquo;s requirements. Since we really thought that this (i.e., the sequence of ideas in the outline) was the best way to tell this contribution, at this point we started looking at alternative venues which had a similar audience and quality, but less restrictive format.  Step 9. Draft the actual text By now you have gone through the sequence of ideas with your co-authors so many times (about five?), that the message and how to communicate it should be quite clear. In fact, you probably had to repress the impulse to start drafting text already. For me, that is the great advantage of this approach to writing papers: instead of struggling with the blank page and with drafting the text, by the time you reach step #9, half of the paper is already written in your mind, and you are actually glad you are \u0026ldquo;finally writing\u0026rdquo;. Another advantage is that this step of drafting text is (at least for me) so much faster! Depending on the length and complexity of the paper, once all the other pieces are in place, writing the text will take me only about 2-3 full days of work \u0026ndash; much shorter (and much more enjoyable) than it would have been if I had been drafting (and re-drafting based on co-author feedback) all along. When I reach this point, I also make sure that I am using the author guidelines and templates of the target journal/conference4.\nOnce you have completed this first draft of real text, you can put it in the drawer for a couple of days, and take it out of your head. Then, you can come back and read it again (you will probably see typos or things that are not understandable, or that you don\u0026rsquo;t like) and edit your text a bit. Then, it is good to send it once again to your co-authors for feedback. By now the discussions about structure, main message and so on should be over, and feedback will probably be more fine-grained, maybe about style, missing or superfluous details, etc.\nStep 10. Revise, generate final draft and submit! Once you got the feedback from your co-authors, you can edit again the text to consider that feedback. If everyone is happy with the state of the paper, now it\u0026rsquo;s time to submit! Re-check (if you did not do so in previous steps) that you are following the author guidelines and templates of the journal or conference\u0026hellip; and submit the paper to your target venue using the corresponding submission system.\n You can see a preprint of our example paper, with the version that we first submitted to a journal, here. As mentioned in the previous post, the story of the paper still goes on, as this first journal rejected the paper (even if reviewers remarked only minor weak points). Since no big amendments had been made to the core contribution of the paper, after a few enhancements we submitted it to a second journal. The reviewers of the second journal also have proposed a few revisions to it, which have led to the revised version that is again under review.  That\u0026rsquo;s it. \r\r\rMy paper writing process\n\r\r\rThis 10-step process may seem long (mostly because I was not able to shorten more my narration of it), but it is surprisingly efficient. If you ever have tried to draft a paper in a more unstructured way, and gotten a group of engaged co-authors to give you substantial feedback, you will realize how much shorter, time-wise, this 10-step process is (e.g., my first journal paper took some nine months to be written, using a much more chaotic process). To give you a rough estimation, this kind of process makes you spend about 70% of the time planning the paper, 10% drafting actual text, and 20% revising the text with your co-authors. While this heavy emphasis on planning seems odd at first, it is among the best practices recommended by many scientific writing courses5. And there is also some evidence from studies that suggest that students that plan so much at the outset feel more productive and find writing less difficult6!\nCaveats and other disclaimers As I mentioned at the outset of the previous post, this is just my process. It is not the only, or the best process in absolute terms (because there is no such a thing as the perfect process that works in every situation). For some people, starting with the \u0026ldquo;big idea in a sentence\u0026rdquo; may seem impossible. The ideas may not be so clear yet, you feel like you have 37 different things to say about the topic. For those people, sometimes it is recommended to do a bit of \u0026ldquo;free writing\u0026rdquo; first7, which I incorporate into my method as:\nStep 0. Write some text for yourself / Write an internal research report. If you do not know exactly what the main message is, and you don\u0026rsquo;t even feel comfortable generating a few options (see step #1), you can just try to write something. Anything. For 5-10 minutes, write for yourself whatever comes to mind that the paper could be remotely about. You will not show this to others. Don\u0026rsquo;t bother finding the exact right word if it does not come to mind. Go on and write until your fountain of ideas runs dry.\nAnother way of doing this step #0 is to write an internal report about the research you did. Again, write it more for yourself than for others8, explaining what you did and why, and what were your results. Write everything that you think may be relevant.\nThen, try something like reverse outlining on that. Go from the jumbled set of sentences to something like a hierarchy of ideas (with maybe some unconnected ideas as well). See which of those ideas seem more important, interesting, and supported by your evidence or data. Probably that is a good point to start (see step #1). And anyways you will soon put this idea in front of your co-authors, so they can also help you weed out the really important ideas from the more superfluous ones.\nA last disclaimer: the process I presented above looks linear and predictable, right? However, you may find that sometimes you need to backtrack several steps, if you or your co-authors see that a substantial change of direction is needed. Luckily, following this process also minimizes the possibility of drastic changes: you may have to rethink some section weights, move a few bullets around, change figures to match the new main idea\u0026hellip; but probably you will not have to start all over again. And even if you had, throwing 3 pages of outline in the bin is much less painful than doing so with 15 pages of beautifully crafted prose!\nNow is probably a good moment to wrap it up. Stop reading blog posts, and start writing. Believe me, with practice, a certain sense of ease will come. Heck, even enjoyment of writing a paper. I, for one, enjoy writing now \u0026ndash; to the point that I started this blog to write some more, on top of my daily scientific writing! But I still remember the block, the fear of failure, of rejection. It all starts by saying \u0026ldquo;$%$\u0026amp;@# it\u0026rdquo; and writing something. Do a pomodoro. Do only one step of the process.\nDo. It. Now.\nIf you have never used this kind of process for writing papers, why don\u0026rsquo;t you give it a try for your next paper? Then, let me know how it went in the comments below!\n Pro tip: Extra points if you include also logical connectors to previous/next bullets (i.e., words like \u0026ldquo;however\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;on the other hand\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;besides\u0026rdquo;, etc.), if applicable. I find this really enhances the coherence and readability, not only of the outline itself, but also of the actual text that you will write later on around it.\r[return] Of course, this is terribly unfair after you have spent so many hours perfecting every little detail of your manuscript. But these people do exist. And you may cross ways with them. So better be prepared, just in case that happens. And don\u0026rsquo;t even think that doing good, coherent text is not so important then, because in most good journals you get more often the \u0026ldquo;very detailed, I want to understand everything\u0026rdquo; kind of reviewer. You certainly have to write for those readers as well. The main underlying point: a paper needs to enable multiple kinds of reading in an effective way: the very fast, and the very detailed, and anything in between!\r[return] You are using a reference manager. That was not a question. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use one yet, go and start using one right now (your first paper is actually a good moment to start building your reference library). Just do it. You can thank me later. The topic of what is the right reference manager can also span a whole separate post. Personally, I have found lately that Zotero fits quite well my needs and workflow (good integration with Word and Google Docs, good enough Bibtex support, etc.). But I have used different ones over the years, and your mileage may vary\u0026hellip;\r[return] Sometimes I apply these author guidelines and template as early as step #5. This has the advantage of helping you track length more accurately (if the target venue measures length in pages, not words). However, as we saw in my example paper, sometimes we change the target venue mid-way through the writing process. Thus, my advice would be to apply the template whenever you feel that the target venue is well-fixed and will likely not change until submission.\r[return] See, for example, Stanford\u0026rsquo;s course \u0026ldquo;Writing in the Sciences\u0026rdquo;. Indeed, this is a very good course on scientific writing in general, if you want to dive a bit deeper in how to get good (or at least, competent) at writing your papers.\r[return] Torrance, M., Thomas, G.

Yet, I\u0026rsquo;ve found most of that advice tends to be abstract, or focused on the final product, never giving you a step-by-step account of the process. In this post, I share the writing process I find myself using after 70+ academic publications. This will give you an idea of where to start writing your paper (especially if you have never written one), and it will show you that all polished papers have humble (even crappy) origins. Kill perfectionism, and the dreaded \u0026ldquo;academic writer\u0026rsquo;s block\u0026rdquo; will eventually disappear.\nIn a previous post, I went over several reasons why I think scientific writing is difficult for many doctoral students: the lack of specific training, the focus on the finished product (vs. how to get there), the fact that it is a collaborative process, or that many of us don\u0026rsquo;t use our mother tongue when we write. As a way to counter many of those, I thought it could be useful to share what my own writing process is1, which I have come to after more than 10 years of trying (and quite a few \u0026ldquo;loaves of bread sold\u0026rdquo;2). This process assumes that you are collaborating with others, in that it defines when and what to send to co-authors and other collaborators. This is also the process that we recommend in the \u0026ldquo;writing seminar\u0026rdquo; I have helped teach at our university.\nThis may result in a post longer than usual, so\u0026hellip; For those of you that want to get to the point right away and run off:\n\r\r\rMy paper writing process\n\r\r\rFor those of us that need a bit more explanation, read on below. I will try to illustrate each step with an example from a recent paper I co-authored (still under review)3. You will see how different the finished product is, compared with its humble origins:\nStep 1. Define the main idea Once you decide you want to write a paper, start with a blank piece of paper (e.g., a post-it), or a new document in your computer. Do not start from the full report of your study4, or other random pieces of text you may have written during your research about the topic. Blank paper. OK, now, just try to answer in one sentence: What is the paper about? What is the main research contribution5 you are trying to make here? or, in other words, what is the \u0026ldquo;reusable knowledge\u0026rdquo; that you think other researchers need to know, and could build upon? Write that one sentence down. That\u0026rsquo;s it!6\n Diving into my archives I found the earliest \u0026ldquo;main idea\u0026rdquo; I had about this recently-published paper of mine: \u0026ldquo;Active or passive [data] gathering? Design-based research studies on technological support for evidence-based teacher reflection\u0026rdquo;. As you can see, this initial idea had quite a few problems (for starters, it was two sentences, not one! plus, what is the new knowledge I wanted to convey is not very clear either). It looks nothing like the final title of the paper. However, it tried to convey that it was about certain studies we had done, and that active/passive data gathering seemed to play an important role in what we discovered. That will have to do for now. Let\u0026rsquo;s move on.  Step 2. Define the audience This one is probably the first point where my advice may deviate from other advice out there. Scientific writing (or any writing, really) is basically an act of communication. And, by definition, it requires a sender (you), a message (see point #1), and a receiver. You have to have one. Pitching a contribution to the wrong audience is one of the most common causes of rejection for scientific papers, so\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t make this mistake. Define who will be interested in the main idea of the paper, who cares about this kind of thing you\u0026rsquo;re proposing. If it\u0026rsquo;s your first paper, you may not be sure, and that\u0026rsquo;s OK. But there are things you can do to find out, like a) asking your advisor or more experienced colleagues; b) looking at similar papers you have read: which conferences or journals are they published in? Narrow it down to 1-3 concrete options of journals/conferences. Write them down. Look at the venue\u0026rsquo;s author and submission guidelines. The good thing about setting this from the outset is that now you have already indications of the expected length of the piece, its tone, level of specificity, things the readers probably know already, etc.\n I initially set my paper to be sent to the British Journal of Educational Technology (BJET). The main reasons for this decision were that it was a journal in the field of educational technology, and a really inter-disciplinary one (our paper was neither very technical nor very educational), that it is quite high-quality and high-impact, and that they make a point of publishing research that also has relevance for teachers (which I think our paper idea had)7.  Step 3: Define the team Once you know what you write about and for whom, you can decide who can help you in doing it. In most fields, you do not do your research alone, but collaborating with others (but in some fields it may be required that you write some papers alone \u0026ndash; check with your advisors). This additional team members can be your advisor(s), some colleague who helped you with the data gathering or data analysis8\u0026hellip; but think wider. Is there somebody else you know (in your department, or elsewhere) who knows a lot about the literature on topic X that your paper addresses? or data analysis technique Y? That could save you some time, and this person could bring in new, interesting ideas to the paper.\nThen, send your idea and target venue to potential co-authors: this can be a short email, a chat over coffee\u0026hellip; The main point is to pitch them the idea, see what they think and whether they are interested. In this process, it is good that you set expectations about what their role will be, how much time you think this will take them, what can be the expected author order, etc. All of those can change during the writing process (depending on how the different people behave), but it is good to have some baseline expectation. From this conversation, you can already get some valuable information to help you refine the core idea (maybe they think this is not about keyword X, but rather keyword Y, or they suggest some other venue for publication, or analyses that you had not run yet).\n In my paper\u0026rsquo;s case, I simply told my boss back then, that I was thinking of writing this paper for this venue (he agreed). I also contacted the professional development specialist who had helped co-design the tool we were proposing, and helped manage the data gathering in the school. Later on during the process, I also contacted one of my PhD students, since her topic was closely related to that of the paper \u0026ndash; and she was doing a lot of reading on some of the related literature we needed to cover anyway.  Step 4: Write a pseudo-abstract Now that you have an idea of something scientific to write about, some scholars you want to tell it to, and some people we want to write it with, let\u0026rsquo;s flesh out the idea a little bit more. Not a lot. Just a little bit. I call this step \u0026ldquo;pseudo-abstract\u0026rdquo;, because it more or less has all the elements that a good abstract should have\u0026hellip; only it is not really an abstract (i.e., one paragraph of nice text) yet. It is basically a series of bullet points with simple, clear messages, in three parts9: a) what is known about the topic of the paper (1-3 bullets); b) what this paper adds to such current knowledge, i.e., what contribution(s) it brings (1-2 bullets); and c) what are the implications of this contribution for other researchers, or practitioners, policy-makers or the society at large (1-3 bullets). Keep the bullets as complete sentences, but simple ones (e.g., not more than 100 characters). You can also think about this step as the \u0026ldquo;grandmother\u0026rsquo;s version of your scientific contribution\u0026rdquo; (i.e., how you would communicate this contribution to a non-expert) \u0026ndash; remember, most of our grandmothers are not biochemists or sociology researchers!\n Below, you can see a pseudo-abstract for the same paper, which I did some months later than the original \u0026ldquo;main idea\u0026rdquo;. You can see that the title there has already changed (but still looks pretty generic), and some more ideas have been added, especially regarding what is known about the topic (i.e., what would be the main take-away message from the literature about the relevant keywords, like \u0026ldquo;teacher reflection\u0026rdquo;), and what are the implications (in this case, how a teacher or a school leader could use the tools/ideas we present in the paper).  \r\r\rExample pseudo-abstract from a real paper\n\r\r\rStep 5: Create a weighted outline Now that you have fleshed out the basic idea, let\u0026rsquo;s start thinking about how we are going to write it. A first step in this is to do an outline of the sections of the paper, as you would find it in a table of contents of a book: sections, subsections, sub-subsections\u0026hellip; And, since we already know where we want to send it, we know how long the paper should be (in pages, or words), so we can assign estimated lengths to every section and subsection10. Why do this weighted outline? First, it makes us reflect about the relative importance of the different parts of the text (i.e.: more important parts \u0026ndash;like the paper\u0026rsquo;s main contribution\u0026ndash; should be described in more detail, and hence should be longer). Secondly, and since for many people writing is a bit painful, we do not want to write 30 pages of text on a topic, only to find out that we only needed three pages (so, we have to throw away 90% of that hard-worked text). Furthermore, downsizing text is just plain difficult: once you got used to saying things at a certain level of detail, it has some kind of \u0026ldquo;anchoring effect\u0026rdquo; that makes it very difficult to change our frame of mind (i.e., we think that all we said there is really important to be said). In a sense, making this weighted outline tries to put the anchoring on your side so that you will keep the paper close to the length you actually need.\nOnce you have the main idea (which can be the working title), the co-authors, the target venue, the pseudo-abstract and the weighted outline, it is a good moment to send all this to the co-authors for feedback. This should be a one-page document, so it is more likely that even busy people can give you quickly some ideas about the general direction, section titles and relevant keywords, etc. Once you get this feedback and make the necessary corrections, you can also polish this into an actual title, abstract and outline with lengths, which you can send to the editor of your target journal(s), to inquire whether they think this kind of paper fits the scope of the journal \u0026ndash; and their opinion actually matters a lot, since they are the first filter even before your paper reaches the reviewers! Although they are not obliged to answer, they will often be nice enough to tell you (since by responding, they will get either a good paper, or less out-of-scope papers, later on).\n You can take a look at the weighted outline from my example paper here, which I did still thinking about sending it to the BJET journal, which had a maximum length of 6,000 words. One thing you can notice is that some of the subsections end up being very short (100 words?), which should have made me think that something was not totally right (one-paragraph sections are rare!). Also, the total length was well over 80% of the hard limit (since you also have to count abstract and the other front matter in those 6,000 words). As you will see, these clues became quite important later on\u0026hellip;  More steps\u0026hellip; after the break Wow, this post is getting a bit long! Since we have now reached the middle point within the process, and it was a lot to absorb, I think we can make a break here, until next week. Then, we will go into the details of the paper. As they say, the devil is always in the details but, once the groundwork of these first five steps is there, and you have already gotten feedback from your co-authors a couple of times, you can have some confidence that your shot (and the effort that each step takes) cannot go too far off the mark.\nIn the meantime, why don\u0026rsquo;t you give these five steps a try? Do you have an idea for a paper about some research you did, but you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start? Try this and let me know how it went, in the comments below!\n The emphasis on \u0026ldquo;my own\u0026rdquo; is important. Writing is still mostly an art (yes, even scientific writing), a very complex skill that requires many smaller skills and abilities, which not all of us can tap in the same way. As they say, \u0026ldquo;your mileage may vary\u0026rdquo;. Even I don\u0026rsquo;t always follow this process every single time (e.g., if I\u0026rsquo;m pressed for time, I might jump a step here and there). This process is just what most of my writing processes resemble, especially if I have some kind of control about the paper (e.g., if I am the first author).\r[return] If you don\u0026rsquo;t get the reference, go read the previous post.

A paper is a wholly different thing, and the audience is normally interested in a small subset of that only.\r[return] The topic of what constitutes a valid research contribution is a complex and thorny one, since it varies a lot depending on your research field. In general, it seems that most fields require that a contribution is a piece of reusable knowledge (i.e., you can convey it to others and they can reproduce it and build upon it), which is relevant to a certain scientific community (e.g., astrophysicists, engineers, linguists, whatever your field is), which is novel (i.e., new and non-obvious), and has some kind of usefulness (but this one varies a lot from applied to more basic/theoretical fields). Furthermore, you have to provide some evidence that all of the above is true (be it with mathematical proofs, data from empirical studies, or whatever method your field considers valid). In the end, the goal of the paper and its different parts is basically to prove your point on all these regards!\r[return] Pro tip: instead of writing the one idea in a piece of paper, try writing three different main ideas in three post-its, and then choose the best one (or pitch them to a colleague). You can even go further and try what in design circles is called \u0026ldquo;crazy 8s\u0026rdquo; (i.e., eight different ideas for the main contribution, in 8 minutes). Try to make each idea meaningful, different from the previous ones, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry if they end up being crap. That is the whole point of the exercise. For empirical proof that this seems to help both the quality of the outputs and your own feeling of self-efficacy, see, for example, Dow, S. P., Glassco, A., Kass, J., Schwarz, M., Schwartz, D.

In case you\u0026rsquo;re curious, the main reason for the eventual change was that our draft ended up being much longer than what the journal allowed. This was in part due to my lack of discipline when writing, and the fact that we chose to tell our contribution in a way that could not really be made much shorter. Even when we changed our target journal to another one more adequate to the manuscript length, but with similar characteristics to BJET, our paper was rejected (i.e., the reviewers did not appreciate the contribution enough). Thus, we had to improve the paper based on some of the reviewer feedback and find yet another journal to submit it to \u0026ndash; where it is now under review. In retrospect, I\u0026rsquo;d say that this last journal was probably the best choice anyway (it\u0026rsquo;s just that we did not even know about this journal at the outset when the paper started). This is worth taking into account: no plan survives contact with reality \u0026ndash; but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have one.\r[return] Who should count as co-author in your papers? This is another topic for an entire post, but for now: anybody that made substantial contributions to the design, data gathering, analysis or interpretation of the evidence; AND helps you drafting or revising the paper; AND checks out the final version for publishing; AND agrees to be responsible for its contents. You can check out things like the Vancouver Convention, or this very complete site from the Norwegian Research Ethics Committee.\r[return] This kind of structure is used in many journals, under the name \u0026ldquo;highlights\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;practitioner notes\u0026rdquo;. Basically, they are aimed at summarizing the paper in a nutshell, in relatively simple language, so that other scientists and people that are not necessarily experts in your field, can understand them\u0026hellip; which is precisely what we want to do at this point!\r[return] Pro tip: journals and conferences normally offer a hard maximum length limit\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t target that number! make it about 80% of the length limit, or even less if you think the contribution should be shorter. You will probably go over your target length anyways during the writing of actual text \u0026ndash; and shortening text is both painful and difficult.\r[return]  ","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/","tags":["Writing","Research","Papers"],"title":"How I write papers"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"Writing (papers or the dissertation itself) is one of the activities that many doctoral students hate the most. Why is this act of communication so difficult for us? As a prelude to my post on \u0026ldquo;how I write papers\u0026rdquo;, I expose some misconceptions we seem to have about scientific writing and what are good ways to learn it.\nScientific writing is one of the most dreaded tasks for many Ph.D. students1, and understandably so. Unless you are in the humanities, you probably signed up to \u0026ldquo;do science\u0026rdquo;: do experiments, gather evidence, analyze data, read tons of books\u0026hellip; not to become an accomplished writer! To make matters worse, doctoral programs have surprisingly little training on basic (and specifically scientific) writing skills. It seems like we either assume that 1) people come to the doctoral level already knowing how to write scientific texts; or 2) it is such an easy skill to master that it\u0026rsquo;s pointless to teach it. Lets look at these two assumptions:\nIt is an easy skill. Sadly, for most doctoral students, their scientific writing training is reduced to \u0026ldquo;read a lot of scientific papers and you will get it\u0026hellip; eventually\u0026rdquo;. But probably you see the problem here: it is quite difficult to acquire a skill to make something just by seeing finished products (i.e., published papers). This is a bit like training bakers to make bread, just by showing them finished, beautifully decorated loafs of bread and baguettes. Imagine bakers not being encouraged to get their hands dirty with flour! Luckily, our bakers probably get proper vocational training in which they see how their products are manufactured from start to finish. As a consequence, I have yet to meet a baker that is terrified of making bread.\n\r\r\rA baker scared of bread\n\r\r\rPeople already know how to write. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s what our primary and secondary schools are for, right? or the bachelors, or the masters. The problem is that scientific writing is a very particular genre, with values and criteria that are quite different from literary writing (which focuses on aesthetics or emotional impact), political or marketing writing (focusing on persuasion, when not obfuscation), or the kind of \u0026ldquo;composition piece writing\u0026rdquo; that many of us learned at school (which focuses on piling up text until you have X number of words). This kind of \u0026ldquo;writing by accumulation of words\u0026rdquo; leads to doctoral student texts often lacking structure, preciseness, and being an over-long mishmash of ideas. Scientific writing focuses on logical argumentation, clarity of concepts, unambiguity, traceability of sources\u0026hellip; very, very different from any other genre. Coming back to the baker metaphor, it\u0026rsquo;s like trying to make soufflés when you have been doing coarse whole-wheat bread all your life (it might not occur to you that texture is important, or that you can actually put sugar in these things!).\n\r\r\rA baker not used to sugar\n\r\r\rAside from these two misconceptions, there are plenty of other complicating factors, like the fact that English (the dominant language in most scientific fields) is not the native language of a big majority of our doctoral students. Most of our training as writers has probably developed in an entirely different language. Try to make a soufflé after growing up somewhere in Asia where wheat or milk were rare or unheard of\u0026hellip;\nAnd there is yet another difference between scientific writing and other genres: it is, more often than not, a collaborative process. Although, as a doctoral student, you find yourself writing mostly on your own, chances are that you will get feedback from your advisors or other colleagues at some point. During the publishing process, reviewers and editors will also help you make a better paper out of your ideas (even if we do not always perceive it as a collaboration). This collaborative nature of scientific writing begs many questions: at what point should I share my ideas with collaborators, and in which form? is it better to do it often or rarely? what if they are too busy or too slow? et cetera. Again, if you have never baked bread with other people, it may be puzzling who should do what, and at what point in time.\n\r\r\rCollaborative bakery is not easy\n\r\r\rThese misconceptions and differences (along with the fact that more senior researchers and advisors seldom recognize having difficulties in writing) lead to students being ashamed when they have writing problems, which in turn leads to anxiety, \u0026ldquo;writer\u0026rsquo;s block\u0026rdquo;, etc. Maybe this is also why I seldom get the question \u0026ldquo;How do you write papers?\u0026ldquo;.\nSo, you did not ask for it but\u0026hellip; In the next post, I will share the step-by-step process I find myself following after (collaboratively) authoring and publishing more than 70 scientific papers. The misconceptions and issues that I just described have shaped that writing process, as well as the principles behind it (my \u0026ldquo;10 commandments of writing\u0026rdquo;, also in a later post). For now just remember that, as a Ph.D. student, you are not alone in these hardships. We all faced them. We all learned\u0026hellip; eventually. More or less.\nTalk to others.\nSee how they get out of their writer\u0026rsquo;s block.\nDo you agree with these problems and misconceptions?

I hope that the awareness of these factors (from gender to other things you can actually change in your everyday life) will help you understand why some people struggle doing a PhD, while for others it seems a piece of cake. Change what you do and put the odds on your side!\nAs we have seen, depression and anxiety are an increasingly common ailment of Ph.D. students. So much so that, if you don\u0026rsquo;t experience these symptoms yourself during the Ph.D., chances are somebody else around you (e.g., a colleague, or a friend) will.\nThe good news is that many of these studies that determined how frequent mental health issues are in the Ph.D., also investigate what factors seem to correlate (and how much) with symptoms of anxiety or depression (or stress in general). Let\u0026rsquo;s review the most common ones.\nThe Big Five As it often happens when you start reading research studies on anything, each study is a bit different, measures things differently, was done on a different population\u0026hellip; so it is hard to have a single, very accurate picture. Yet, there are five factors that appear again and again in the studies on doctoral student mental health:\n Gender: In many of the studies I have read gender was discovered to be significantly related with depression and anxiety symptoms. For instance, in a recent study, women were about 17% more likely to be depressed than men1, and in another around 27% more likely2. Often, the effect on anxiety is even higher than on depression3. Being trans-gender or being gay have also been related even more strongly with depression (in different studies, trans were 60% more likely1, and gay were almost 4 times as likely than heterosexuals3). Why is this? Multiple things can be at play: the fact that many academic fields are still male-dominated (and heterosexuals dominate in almost any population), which can lead to students not feeling like \u0026ldquo;they belong\u0026rdquo;4; or the fact that, in many cultures, women tend to have less difficulty in expressing their emotions, which is what many of the mental health questionnaires ask about (so, rather than men not being depressed, they might just be hiding it more)5. Strong social ties are another factor that appears very often in these studies. By this I mean really close social relationships like having children (which lowered the odds of being depressed by about 35%2). In many of the studies, being married or having a stable partner also were related with lower rates of depression (in one study, 42% lower odds of depression3). It looks like having somebody to talk and support you through the hardships of the doctorate, or someone that really clarifies your priorities (as a crying baby often does), can be quite protective against the rumination and thought patters that lead to depression. Economic situation is another one that comes up quite often: not surprisingly, having problems making ends meet does not help with anxiety and depression. However, the effect varies a lot from study to study, and from country to country, from 5% more chances6 to almost three times more likely to get depressed3. Even the economic situation of your parents seems to have this effect!7 And the problem is, in most countries, being a PhD student is a low-pay, high-workload job. Related to this issue, how do you perceive your career prospects (i.e., will there be a good job for you after the doctorate) is also mentioned in several places as having an impact in the mental health of PhD students5,8. Work-life balance. This one is not very surprising either, and it is named and measured in different ways: family-work conflict, job demands vs. job control, \u0026hellip; People that perceive their work-life balance to be unhealthy, are more than twice as likely to be depressed1, and experiencing work-family conflicts can also raise your odds of depression between 30-50%2. High job demands (defined as \u0026ldquo;physical, social or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical or mental effort\u0026rdquo;) also seem related to depression (60% more likely2). Conversely, having high job control (of your work environment, pace of work, timing of breaks, etc.) seems to lower the chances of depression by about 40%2. Supervisor relationship. This is the one many of you were waiting for. Researchers have dedicated a lot of effort to study this factor from different angles, like the prior expertise of the supervisor, the supervisory style, leadership style\u0026hellip; However, the results here are rather heterogeneous, and their importance varies a lot8. People who perceive their supervisor as not providing mentorship, support, or emotional impact, were 50% more likely to be depressed in one study1, while in some other research, having an \u0026ldquo;inspirational\u0026rdquo; supervisor lowered the odds of depression by about 10%2. In the same study, having a \u0026ldquo;laissez-faire\u0026rdquo; kind of supervisor raised the odds of depression/anxiety symptoms between 4-8%. In general, this issue of the supervisor style is quite difficult to tackle, as it seems to be also very cultural, and very personal (some studies mention that the important thing is that supervisor and student styles are compatible). I will dedicate a separate post to this issue alone.  There are plenty of other factors that have been studied, but either their change in odds is small9, or there is not enough agreement about them across studies. There is also the issue of whether these factors are causes or effects. When reading this, one should bear in mind the old adage: \u0026ldquo;correlation is not causation\u0026rdquo;. Most probably, the relationship between depression and these demographic and contextual factors is quite complex, with confounding factors and feedback loops. The way I see it: the Ph.D. is a highly uncertain, intense, ill-defined process where often long stretches of time pass without any meaningful feedback about whether you\u0026rsquo;re making any progress. Hence, it is crucial to have a variety of social (and economic) support to remind you that you are a worthy human being (and to lower the stakes of such huge effort).\nBut wait, you may say: why are you telling us about these risk factors, if they are all things we have little control about? It is not like we are going to have kids or change gender just to protect ourselves from depression. It is true that these demographic factors are the most studied so far, probably because they set some kind of baseline, your starting point for the odds of being depressed. But, once you know this starting point, this is when the fun begins\u0026hellip;\nWhat can you actually do? One interesting thing about many of these studies on risk factors for anxiety and depression, it that they run these regression models on multiple factors, which includes some measures of how predictive they are. For example, some paper2 might tell you that their R-squared was 0.2, meaning that their model (taking into account supervision, gender, and several other things) explains only 20% of the variance of the data. That also means there is an 80% of the variance (read: whether you get depressed or not) that must be due to other things: personal factors, individual circumstances and events, etc. This is compatible with the arguments of many positive psychologists, which say that our happiness is a composite of genetic factors (about 50%, according to some accounts), our current circumstances (10%), and an ample 40% for what they call \u0026ldquo;intentional activity\u0026rdquo;, i.e., things we can actually do to change our happiness levels 10.\nSo, has science also studied what Ph.D. students can do to avoid depression and anxiety? Yes. Kinda. Truth is, the evidence on these is normally from smaller, non-representative populations (e.g., there is a ton of studies on just psychology doctoral students). Thus, there are not big guarantees that the results will apply to you. In any case, here are a few ideas:\n Sleep. Having healthy sleep habits is one of the most powerful correlates against depression across studies. And it maybe the one that appears most consistently across the studies I\u0026rsquo;ve read, both when studying stress 11,12,5 and depression13 of doctoral students. Hence, if you found in my first blog post that you might be at risk of depression, and you see that sleep can be a problem for you, maybe trying to fix your sleep hygiene14 is the first thing I would try. If just fixing your sleep hygiene does not cut it, I\u0026rsquo;ve had quite good results with progressive muscle relaxation exercises, but you can also look around in the web for other techniques, or go to a sleep therapist.\n Social support. This is the other big, consistent contributor to avoid depression across studies 5,12,15, as already hinted by some of the other factors mentioned above. One might think that our social circles (i.e., how many friends or acquaintances we have) are not really under our control. However, there are things one can decide to do, like seeking help (one study7 found that help-seeking behaviors are relatively rare among depressed students, only about 30%), or joining a writing support group8, if your university has one. Heck, just heading out for a social evening with friends or colleagues can take you out of your rut if you do it wholeheartedly (even if it is, of course, the last thing you want to do when you are in a depressed mood).\n Exercise. This is another well-known one. However, from the studies I\u0026rsquo;ve read the effect is not always clear: in some studies it is found as a protective factor against psychological ill health16, in others it is not significant12, while in others it is correlated with higher stress! (although the authors argue that this is due to students already using exercise as a coping strategy against the stress that is already there)11. In general, I think it is safe to assume that being in good physical health makes you less prone to falling into depression5,17, so keeping some exercise routine, eating healthily16, etc. is probably a good idea.\n Mindful acceptance. Now we come to the less-well-known ones. I was quite surprised to find some studies looking at this trait in students, and finding very large effects or correlations with lower perceived stress (more than twice as much as the sleep hygiene in one study12, and also found significant in others18). Despite the new-agey name, this is not to be confused with practicing mindfulness meditation (which was not found a significant predictor in some of the same studies, once you control for this acceptance trait12). Looking around, I found definitions like \u0026ldquo;experiencing events fully and without defense, as they are\u0026rdquo;19, or \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; one lets go of judgment, interpretation, and/or elaboration of internal events, and makes no attempt to change, avoid, or escape from the internal experience [\u0026hellip;] not to be confused with passivity or resignation\u0026rdquo;20. While this might look like a fixed personal trait (you either accept stuff, or you don\u0026rsquo;t), there seem to be ways to train it21. Another topic to dig deeper in a later post\u0026hellip;\n Cognitive reappraisal. Loosely defined as reinterpreting an emotional episode22, this kind of mental technique was found to correlate with lower stress in some of the studies on doctoral students12, but was not found significant in all of them18. Again, I make a mental note to dig deeper into this one, and see if there are easy practices or habits to develop it.\n  Put the odds on your side In summary, it seems that there are a few demographic and contextual factors that seem to be related with higher chances of depression and anxiety - but while they seem to be cumulative, they are not ultimately decisive. Everything in life is a bet, so for this one:\n If you are a Ph.D. student, it is probably good to know your base chances, given the factors above\u0026hellip; but also to know what you can do to prevent it (or at least put the odds on your side). Along with the diagnostic tools we saw in the first post, this gives you a basic toolkit to see how you\u0026rsquo;re doing, understand that many in your position have had similar trouble, and do what you can to help yourself or seek help. If you are thinking of starting a Ph.D., maybe take a look at these factors. If you tick many of the \u0026ldquo;bad boxes\u0026rdquo; above\u0026hellip; this does not necessarily mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it. Diversity is one thing we need in many fields, science included. But rather, understand that it may get difficult at times, that you need to brace yourself, be especially careful in the preventive side and go for it if that\u0026rsquo;s what you want! If you are a supervisor (or a university decision-maker), you may want to check with your students: what is their economic situation? do they have a social circle to support them? are they sleeping? You cannot take many lifestyle choices for them, but there are things among these factors that you can influence (maybe rethink that \u0026ldquo;laissez faire\u0026rdquo; strategy, if that\u0026rsquo;s your advisor style). If your are friends or family with a Ph.D. student, you can also do a quick factor assessment, and be especially attentive if the odds look bad; check in with them from time to time, get out and spend some quality time with them. As you saw above, that alone can go a long way. Telling them about these studies probably won\u0026rsquo;t hurt either.  Despite the depressing tone of all this, do not despair! I also see every day doctoral students that are curious, engaged, having a blast learning to be researchers. Knowing that other, darker paths exist, and knowing your odds, is just a start towards avoiding them. Let us see what other things we discover to keep ourselves on the bright side of science.\n Evans, T. M., Bira, L., Gastelum, J. B., Weiss, L. T., \u0026amp; Vanderford, N. L. (2018).

But at some point, I realized that other, more selfish, reasons were playing out as well. In this personal account I reflect on a chronic problem of academics and Ph.D. students alike, and how I face it through this blog.\nI open my eyes. It\u0026rsquo;s 6:30am. I do not have to wake up for another hour or so. I know my body and my brain would benefit from sleeping again, but it\u0026rsquo;s no use. I\u0026rsquo;m wide awake.\nIn bed, I spend an indeterminate amount of time revising the never-ending list of to-do\u0026rsquo;s for the day: meetings that I dread about administrative tasks and topics that I\u0026rsquo;m barely interested in, reports and funding grants I have to write, emails apologizing for the (now chronic) delays in the latest experiment I\u0026rsquo;m trying to run\u0026hellip;\nAt some point I catch my train of thought: this circular revision of obligations is useless, everything is anyways noted down in my trusted task list. I try to focus a bit on how my body is feeling. The familiar sensations are back. The small knot in the stomach. The tension in the jaw. The heaviness in the eyes. My mind races again, churning new problems - including the fact that I have too many problems. After another while, I decide to get up and do something. Should I catch up with yesterday\u0026rsquo;s emails? Write up a bit more of the latest paper draft, which has been festering in my hard drive for the last months? I extend my arm out of the bed, towards my phone.\nI stop right there, arm in the air. What\u0026rsquo;s important now?\nI get up, go to the kitchen, and I sit down for a few minutes, doing nothing, just trying to follow my own breath. Of course, it is useless. The latest student report that needs feedback, the document for the bid of the new software, all come back around my head. But I try again for a few more minutes. Back to the breath. The class I need to teach later today. Back to the breath.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read enough about this to know what is happening. Today is one of those days. As the day unfolds, I expect some of the other symptoms of low-grade anxiety1 and depression2: the veil of negativity when people propose well-intentioned solutions and ideas to help me (it is so easy to see all the ways in which such ideas can fail), the upwelling of emotion at semi-random moments (sometimes inspiring to the point of tears; but more often as despair, or even despairing at other people\u0026rsquo;s inspiration).\nAnd the reader will surely think: what are you complaining about? You have already your Ph.D., you have a stable(-ish) job in academia, no big personal troubles\u0026hellip; You\u0026rsquo;ve been lucky, you are successful already! That\u0026rsquo;s the salt rubbing on the wound: shouldn\u0026rsquo;t success feel great? Why does it taste of overwhelm? Truth is, success never stopped successful people from feeling depressed or suicidal (ask Kurt Cobain, or these long lists of famous suicidal scientists).\nI get up from the chair, somewhat more focused. I lay down on a yoga mat and stretch for a few minutes. Then I sit down and write. I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel like it. Yet, among the many worries, also one or two ideas had appeared about things that could be useful for others.\nI type furiously. Some sentences seem brilliant, and the hope that they will inspire somebody to change what they do and feel better almost makes me cry. Stupid. After a few sentences, the fountain of words in my head seems to dry up. I stare at the screen. I can feel the fear of failure tightening its grip on my chest: what if people don\u0026rsquo;t like this either? surely others have written about this more eloquently, and with more knowledge than mine? worse, what if nobody reads it? I force myself to write a few more words, not even complete sentences. Just endings or beginnings, like pieces of stairs leading nowhere. Sometimes I cringe at the words that appear on the screen. But I leave them there for now. Probably today\u0026rsquo;s negative frame of mind is not the best to judge their value.\nTwenty-five minutes later, a faint bell rings. The knot in my stomach is still there\u0026hellip; but somehow, it feels less important. My head is a bit clearer. I look at the page. This is not a blog entry yet, only some jambled sentences, keywords and a lot of \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. But it is a beginning3. Somehow, I feel a certain sense of achievement. I have some power for change in the world. Not much. Only a tiny little. Maybe just a percent of a probability of helping somebody, of making the world less of a grim place.\nThis is the second reason why I write these jambled things. Not only to help with something I see around me more and more often: at the university, at home, among my friends and other people of my age. The young professional that stands frozen in his car, prey of an anxiety crisis. The friend that died of a heart attack at 36 due to overwork. And many more like me, with much lighter symptoms. We are among you. And we are legion.\nThe second reason I do this is to help myself out of it.\nOf course, not everyone is like this. There is those people that have the twinkle in the eye, the zest in the voice, which always seem to have ideas, to speak passionately, to inspire while they teach. Maybe I was one of them only a few years ago. But maybe some of those are also like us. I have learned to mistrust outward appearances (or Facebook feeds, for that matter) of success and happiness. The struggle inside, the impostor syndrome, the secret failues \u0026ndash; those we never see. The halo effect when we see others, and the negativity bias when we look at ourselves \u0026ndash; what a dangerous cocktail!\nYet, what can you do? Well, you can start with a couple of things:\n Talk to others about how you feel. Believe me, getting things off your chest (to your partner, to your boss, to a trusted colleague, a close friend or the waiter at the bar) will feel better than just marinating your brain endlessly with them. They might surprise you with the revelation that they feel the same. Or they will give you a different point of view, point out the many positives in your life, or at least show you that they understand. Of course, you will not agree. You will not believe them. Not at first. But let those things marinate in your head for a while\u0026hellip; Find a purpose. Any purpose4. It can be volunteering at your local charity, creating Youtube videos to help others cook delicious meals, the smile of your baby at 4am (just when you thought you were about to kill him). Or it can be how your research will help cure diseases, advance human knowledge or lead to a better world for everyone. Find something that gets you up in the morning (maybe not every day, but most days). And use it. Remind yourself of it.  I will be here.\nWriting.\n If you are curious about anxiety and its symptoms, there are plenty of resources online to educate the general public about it, such as this one at the Mayo Clinic, or this other one. If you want to check yourself for these symptoms, you can resort to widely-used self-report tests like the GAD07. [return] Similarly, for the curious about depression, you can read this, this, or assess yourself with tests like the PHQ9. And, of course, you can check out my first post on depression in the Ph.D. [return] To give you an idea, writing this blog entry took about 4 mornings like this one. Plus a bit more time for editing and making it ready for publication. [return] Please note I didn\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;follow your passion\u0026rdquo; or something like that. I\u0026rsquo;m under the impression that looking for a purpose out of ourselves, bigger than ourselves, might work better than following a \u0026ldquo;passion\u0026rdquo; for cycling, Swedish movies, or collecting cars. But let\u0026rsquo;s leave such psycho-philosophical discussion on purpose for another entry\u0026hellip; [return]  ","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/posts/second-reason/","tags":["Personal","Wellbeing","Anxiety"],"title":"The second reason why I write this blog"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been using for many years. I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, how to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!\nIt is 8:00am. The apartment is quiet and in semi-darkness (the winter sun still hasn\u0026rsquo;t gone up). I put my phone in silent mode, and keep it away from sight. As I sit down to start writing this blog post, I go to my browser and click on the small tomato icon, which turns red, signaling that I have nothing else to do in the next 25 minutes, but write.\nWhat I just described may be quite familiar to some of you: it was me using \u0026ldquo;the pomodoro technique\u0026rdquo;. If somebody asked me which one productivity technique or lifehack I would take to a desert island with me for the rest of my life, it would be this one. By far.\nBut wait, wasn\u0026rsquo;t this blog about PhD students and depression stuff? Well, yes and no. In fact, once people are depressed, probably what they need is a therapist/specialist (not a blogger) to help them out of it. Here, I focus more on the preventive side: how to keep yourself effective and happy so that you finish the PhD and enjoy the ride as much as possible. Once I started looking at the current science of happiness (or \u0026ldquo;positive psychology\u0026rdquo;, as they call it), it seems that having a sense of self-efficacy (read, being and feeling productive) seems to play a large role in it1. So no, not all posts will be depressing - and yes, productivity tips, tricks and routines will feature here from time to time.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s get back to the Pomodoro\u0026hellip;\nA bit of history The Pomodoro Technique \u0026reg; (yes, apparently it is a registered brand) is generally attributed to Francesco Cirillo, who developed it in the 1980s, as a university student looking for \u0026ldquo;a way to get more done in less time\u0026rdquo;. Since then, it has become a very popular \u0026ldquo;lifehack\u0026rdquo;, and now there is an entire book by Cirillo about it2, training courses and certifications, etc. In any case, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t build your whole work life around it, it is a nice little trick to know, and something you can adopt in your own life, right now.\nThis technique is very often used by knowledge workers in many industries, from software development to design, and I know for a fact that many researchers (no matter whether they are early PhD students or seasoned professors) swear by it when they try to stay productive. Oh, and where does the name come from? basically, from the Italian for \u0026ldquo;tomato\u0026rdquo; - Cirillo used a kitchen timer with the shape of a tomato, when he first developed the technique in university.\nHow to do it In case you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go to down to Cirillo\u0026rsquo;s official page (or any of the other dozens of websites and blog posts already describing it), here is a very brief primer on how to start \u0026ldquo;pomodoring\u0026rdquo;, right now:\n Choose a task you want to get done (works especially well for tasks you alone can do, which you\u0026rsquo;ve been procrastinating on). Put away all distractions, especially your phone (which should be put in flight or silent mode) but also email notifications in your computer and other known interruption sources. Make an oath to yourself to work on this task (and only this task) for 25 minutes without interruption. Then, set an actual timer for 25 minutes (some people like physical kitchen timers, but small computer apps also work). Work on the task for the alloted 25 minutes without interruption. Come on, it\u0026rsquo;s just 25 minutes, you can do it! When the timer rings, make a mark on a piece of paper3 and take a break (typically, 5 minutes). Well done! Take a minute to congratulate yourself for advancing in that long-procrastinated task. I\u0026rsquo;m serious. Then, breath, get off your chair, drink a glass of water, stretch, meditate, whatever. That\u0026rsquo;s it!4  Did you do it? How did it feel? Let me know in the comments.\nThe science behind the tomato Despite the technique being mentioned in every other book and article about productivity and graduate students5, there is surprisingly little scientific literature about its use and effectiveness. Aside from several case studies of how it was adopted by different software development firms6, the only real studies I found trying to see if this technique really worked for people was in the field of human-computer interaction, where people design apps to facilitate the practice of the pomodoro, and then evaluate the app (not the method per se). One such study7, about an app that blocks distracting sites in your phone and computer, found that people that used the app did more pomodoros, and felt less stress (the authors argue that it is because you off-load the responsibility of keeping yourself on task to the app). But all these studies tend to be quite small-scale and exploratory.\nOf course, there are plenty of conjectures out there (by Cirillo and others) about why the technique works: because it helps you re-frame time as an event you use to achieve something, instead of a resource you are running out of; the fact that it matches the human attention and focus span; its emphasis on taking breaks periodically (which we too often ignore); etc. But, in the end, it seems that most people supporting it out there, do so out of personal experience. That is also why I recommend it myself: it has worked for me. My guess is that, if you are not a procrastinator, you always get your things done in time and effortlessly\u0026hellip; then, this is not for you. But if you feel overwhelmed by your to-do list (or you don\u0026rsquo;t have a to-do list!) and tend to distract yourself too easily from the important stuff, maybe trying this for a week can change your life forever.\nCaveats As I said, the Pomodoro has been one of my central productivity tricks for many years, and it has helped me greatly when I find myself procrastinating or overwhelmed by obligations at work. However, that does not mean that I use it absolutely all the time. As noted in the Pomodoro booklet and in some criticisms to the technique, there are times when avoiding the Pomodoro is probably a good idea:\n Do not use it when you know you will be interrupted. If you are in your office hours and students are probably coming to see you, or when you are in meetings or your work requires intense teamwork, then it is probably better to not do pomodoros (as it will likely be frustrating to handle what you will see as interruptions). Thankfully, some of the activities in a Ph.D. are solitary almost by definition (e.g., reading, writing your own research), so you will have plenty of opportunity to use the little tomato! Do not use it in your free time. This may seem obvious, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been guilty of trying this myself. As we will see in later posts, resting and unscheduled free time are an essential activity that should be preserved (in the same way sleep is an important part of an athlete\u0026rsquo;s training). Making pomodoros out of leisure activities (e.g., reading a novel for fun) makes them goal-oriented, and will suck the fun out of them very quickly.  Personal experience, tips and tricks In the many years I have been using the Pomodoro technique, I have come across several realizations, tips and tricks about it:\n The timer: When I first discovered the technique, I went out and bought a physical kitchen timer. There was a certain enjoyment in the physicality of setting the timer and hearing the soft tic-tac, but I very soon discovered that not everyone found it as soothing as I did (nor the loud ring at the end!). Since most of my working life occurs within (or nearby) a web browser, I used this nifty little website for a while, and now I use the Marinara Chrome extension. If those options do not fit your particular situation, just pick whatever is easy to call up within your daily routines and workflow (you can Google around for \u0026lsquo;pomodoro timer\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;pomodoro app\u0026rsquo;). I do not recommend using a phone app (the device is often too full of notifications and other potential distractions to outweigh the benefit of the pomodoro). The space: I\u0026rsquo;ve found that how you implement the pomodoro is not as important as where you do it. Choose carefully a space where you are quite sure that no one will interrupt you, and that you will not interrupt or distract yourself. This often rules out your own office, or your kitchen (if you are prone to fridge trips). My personal favorite as of today is the library at our university, as it is close by, it\u0026rsquo;s quite silent, has comfortable chairs/desks, and probably no one is looking for me there8. The distractions. I cannot emphasize this enough: turn off email notifications, and any other notification in your computer (if you are going to work at the computer). And do yourself a favor and put away the phone - really away, as in \u0026ldquo;off your sight, in another room\u0026rdquo; away9. Unless you are expecting a call from the hospital where your grandma is hospitalized, this alone is a productivity tip in itself: once I removed all notifications in my computer (and most of the ones in the phone), my productivity, capacity for attention and general happiness improved markedly. Multi-pomodoro chunks. This is already built-in if you follow Cirillo\u0026rsquo;s full Pomodoro methodology as described in the book. But even if you don\u0026rsquo;t: there is a benefit to doing, say, 4 or 6 pomodoros in a row. There is only so much you can do in 25 minutes, and for really difficult, analytical or creative tasks, a single pomodoro just gets you started. Hence, set aside 2-3 hours for these important, hard tasks, and do several pomodoros in a row, focused on the same task (still taking breaks, but not starting a different task). Peak stress use: I use the technique most intensely (and reap the most benefits from) when facing \u0026ldquo;peak stress\u0026rdquo; moments. Sometimes you have a hard, complex deadline coming close (e.g., when preparing an experiment, when writing a paper or a funding proposal you cannot postpone), and you realize there are still 10-20 different things you need to do in only a few days. In these cases, I just make a list of the tasks, decide their importance, dependencies and sequence, and then budget a number of pomodoros (up to the number of pomodoros I can realistically do in the few remaining days) to each of them. Then, I commit to doing the best I can in the very limited time allotted to each task, but no more (a use of the Pareto principle - you often can get 80% of the results with the first 20% of your efforts). The results are not perfect (tip: they never are), but they are much better than the alternative - an even lousier job due to not sleeping at all, or total breakdown and failing to meet the deadline at all. Effects on mood: Although I only have subjective, anecdotal evidence of this, I have observed that the days when I manage to use this technique more consistently, seem to correlate with more intense feelings of effectiveness and accomplishment. In general, not only more stuff gets done, I\u0026rsquo;m just in a better mood throughout the day! Collective pomodoros: This one is mentioned in Wang et al.\u0026rsquo;s paper6, and I know of Ph.D. students that work in the same office that have used it. Basically, a co-located group of people agrees certain stretches of time to synchronize and do pomodoros together (even if everyone works on their own thing). This social variant of the pomodoro has several intuitive advantages, like reducing interruptions from your co-workers, and allowing for nicer breaks in which you can socialize with your office mates, feel less awkward stretching, etc. In a sense, this is similar to a \u0026ldquo;Shut up and write\u0026rdquo;, to which I will probably dedicate a separate entry in the future.  Just do it. Now. This post just scratched the surface of what the Pomodoro technique can do for you10. If you have read so far and you have not done a pomodoro yet, now it is the time to do so. Go back to the step number 1 above, choose the most important and difficult thing you have to do today, and do a pomodoro. Just one. Just now.\nA small notification appears in the lower right corner of the screen: take a small break. I look at my screen: the text is still convoluted and long, far from perfect, but not too bad for only 25 minutes of work11. As I get up and stretch my arms over my head, I revel in the feeling of having created something (even if it is an incomplete, imperfect something). It was worth the time.\n Ryan, R.

[return] There are also earlier, probably shorter versions of the book also floating around on the \u0026lsquo;Net, like this one. [return] This is basically to record (to celebrate!) that you completed one pomodoro. If you get distracted or interrupt yourself to do something else, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to make this mark. If you do more pomodoros about the same task, or about other tasks during the day, this alone can be a primitive way of measuring your productivity. [return] There is an additional step, which I consider optional: If you are doing multiple \u0026ldquo;pomodoros\u0026rdquo; in a row, take a longer break (say, 15 minutes) after four of them. Take a walk around the building, go chat with somebody, do some burpees\u0026hellip; do not spend this longer break doing email! (I\u0026rsquo;m often guilty of this one, but then it is not a break) [return] See, for example, Lackey, A. E., Moshiri, M., Pandey, T., Lall, C., Lalwani, N., \u0026amp; Bhargava, P. (2014).

It is hard to summarize years of hard work (past and future) into a single page but, as many creative writers will tell you1, being able to distill the most important ideas of a 400-page book into a single page, leads to a clarity of ideas that is often lacking.\nThis is the first of a series of posts on \u0026ldquo;PhD tools\u0026rdquo;: structures, conceptual frameworks or actual hardware/software tools that I (and others) have found useful to advance the Ph.D. dissertation, across different fields. There is lots of general advice out there on how to do diagrams (e.g., for your literature review papers), but not so many that are directly useful for defining the thesis itself. Of course, there are too many research fields and traditions out there, so this particular structure may not fit your particular situation. But I suggest you give it a go - you may be surprised!\nOrigins I first came across this thinking tool when doing my own Ph.D. at GSIC-EMIC, a inter-disciplinary educational technologies lab at the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Back there, it was common advice to fill up one such diagram, once your thesis topic was more or less defined2. Spending an hour diagramming quickly made you realize that things were not as clear as you initially thought, and that your research contributions had more holes than a piece Gruyère cheese\u0026hellip;\nI originally thought that this was just a common researcher device in use everywhere, pretty much like Ellis\u0026rsquo;s problem-goal-question schema0. However, my later travels around different labs have convinced me that this kind of exercise is not common at all (which is why I think this post can be useful). Thus, the diagram is a truly \u0026ldquo;home-brewed\u0026rdquo; thing3, which evolved in an iterative manner since its first (partial) appearance in Asensio-Pérez\u0026rsquo;s thesis0, throughout several other theses45, my own thesis6 and beyond7. We all modified it slightly to fit our particular needs. And we all agree that it was a very useful device to define, understand and communicate our own research.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s hope it helps you too.\nWhat it is As you can see in the thesis references above, the diagram is commonly used in the introduction section of a dissertation, and it is meant to introduce, in graphical form, some of its main elements: the research Context, main research Question, Objectives, Contributions of your thesis and their Evaluation. However, many of us have also used it way before starting to write the dissertation book itself, as a \u0026ldquo;guiding star\u0026rdquo; when discussing with others and planning the thesis work. Below you can see an generic example of such a diagram8. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at each of the elements that make it up:\n\r\r\rA generic CQOCE diagram\n\r\r\r Context. As in, \u0026ldquo;research context\u0026rdquo;. This box is meant to convey where your research sits within the scientific community or communities that are close to what you do. At the beginning of your Ph.D., this box may contain just the name of 1-2 research fields, and/or very general topics within them that interest you. However, as you read more and more literature and understand your field and what is interesting for you, it can become quite specific (see the examples from my own thesis below). Generally, it is also very important to lay out here what is the main problem that you have detected in current research, the \u0026ldquo;hole\u0026rdquo; in the current state-of-the-art that your thesis intends to \u0026ldquo;plug\u0026rdquo;. This basically gives the why of your thesis: what is wrong with our current knowledge of the world, that your thesis tries to make right? Research Question. Probably one of the most obnoxious habits of old professors that one meets randomly during the Ph.D., is to ask: \u0026ldquo;Oh, so you are a doctoral student here\u0026hellip; and what is your research question?\u0026rdquo;. This often leads to the student answering evasively and trying to scurry away. Aside from its obnoxiousness, this question has another interesting property: it is very good at signaling the maturity of a student. If you are able to understand that you are here to further human knowledge, you have identified clearly something that is not known, and formulated it in a single sentence that is actually a question and can be answered with data in a reasonable amount of time, you are almost 50% of the way there (yet another reason why making this diagram is useful). This main research question is probably the element of the diagram that changes most often throughout the Ph.D., normally in the direction from \u0026ldquo;very general, almost impossible to answer even with unlimited funds and manpower\u0026rdquo;, to \u0026ldquo;very specific and convoluted, but with some chance of being answered by a single person in a few years\u0026rdquo;. Objectives: This box tries to answer the question of how would you go about finding out the answer to your research question above. However, it is not really a plan yet: rather, it tries to \u0026ldquo;decompose\u0026rdquo; your research question into more manageable elements, either conceptually (for instance, looking independently into different concepts/keywords that appear in your main research question) or temporally (dealing with A is needed before trying to investigate B). Contributions: This is probably the trickiest element of the diagram to fill in, and the one which I get most questions about. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do a separate post on the whole \u0026ldquo;What counts as a research contribution?\u0026rdquo; question, but here goes the two-sentence version: It is whatever previously unknown, reusable knowledge that you propose or produce during your research, which materializes the answer to your research question. The main problem is that what counts as valid knowledge depends a lot on your research field - which is why you need more experienced peers (like your supervisor, or reading papers from other people in your field), to guide you in defining this. For instance, in many fields (especially, applied ones), a research contribution has to be: a) novel (nobody has done the same or a very similar thing); b) feasible (it can be done practically, it is not just some futuristic fantasy); and c) useful (something that solves an important, relevant problem for some stakeholder). Another tip: very often (but not always), contributions are linked to the different objectives you laid out in the previous box (e.g., each objective is materialized in a contribution that fulfills the objective). Evaluation: Once you have decided what your contribution(s) is/are, you only need to prove that it works as you say it does, e.g., that it is novel, feasible and useful. In many fields, this involves gathering data of some kind from the world, using whatever means at your disposal (from huge radio-telescopes to asking a single person in an interview). This box thus tries to represent graphically how the different data gathering events that you organize, provide this proof for the value of the different contributions you define, to meet the objectives and finally answer the research question of your thesis (see the over-complex examples from my thesis in the figure below).  If all this sounds terribly abstract and vague to you, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you are in good company (everyone thinks so at the beginning). Hopefully, an example will help bring some clarity\u0026hellip; but then again, maybe not, if you are in a field very far away from mine. Therefore, take the example if it helps you, but do not consider it the only way of doing this!\nHow I used it during my Ph.D. Going through my archives from the thesis period, I have found at least 18 different versions of this diagram (hence, not counting those I quickly drew on paper and never made it into my hard drive). Below, you can see three examples spanning the three years that my Ph.D. work lasted: a first one from about six months into the actual Ph.D. work (hand-drawn on the left, mostly in Spanish), another one from around the middle, and the final one that appeared on my dissertation (on the right).\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rCQOCE diagrams for my own thesis, from the beginning of my thesis work (left), mid-way through it (center) and at the defense (right)\n\r\r\rA lot can be said about those particular diagrams (parts of them still make me cringe), but there are three take-aways I want to leave you with: a) your diagram should probably look much simpler than mine (my thesis was too complicated, for reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t need to discuss here); b) it is OK to hand-draw yours (it is often quicker, and has the same communication power); and c) as you can see in the middle one, it is OK to have incomplete or doubtful parts in it. That is the whole point of the diagram: to identify what parts we are unsure of, or have no idea how to deal with, and see how the conception of our own dissertation is changing over time.\nFast-forward six years, and I still use this kind of diagrams when starting a new research line, especially if it is a collaboration with other researchers, and I have to communicate what the main idea and elements of the research are. Which leads me to\u0026hellip;\nWhy use it - and when not to There are several reasons why you might want to give this exercise a go (or recommend it to your students, if you are an advisor):\n It is a useful reflection exercise: In the day-to-day life of a Ph.D. there are so many different tasks, reading papers, planning experiments, gathering data, doing analysis, writing your own papers\u0026hellip; It is very easy for each of these to become a rabbit hole we pursue. Sometimes these meanderings are useful and prompt a permanent change in how you think about your thesis (they become central to it). Sometimes they are just unnecessary distractions. This exercise forces you to stop for a moment 9, and think deeply, and make your current ideas about what you are doing (and why) visible. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ever show it to anybody else, knowing your direction (or even whether there are gaps in your ideas) feels tremendously empowering. As a reminder and prioritization tool. Once you have a version of the diagram in place (even with holes or question marks in it), you can print it and keep it somewhere visible in your office or workspace. And every time you are analyzing data, or reading an interesting paper, or writing your own, or coming up with ideas for cool experiments, you can look at it and think: does it fit or relate with my main problem? is it central or peripheral to it? does it further my contributions? And depending on what your answer is, you can give it a clear priority compared with your other tasks and ideas (or reject it completely\u0026hellip; until you finish the Ph.D. at least). Or you can quickly draw a new box in the diagram, if you think it is really important. Although the two values above are very important, I think the real killer application of this diagram is as a communication tool: It summarizes, in a single page, what the most important question and ideas of your thesis are, and what you are trying to achieve. It also forces you to decide what the right keywords and terminology to use (something different scientific communities are known to be quite picky about) - and elicit problems with the words you use, once you present it to others. You can use it in your meetings with the Ph.D. advisor (to front-load your topic in your advisor\u0026rsquo;s exhausted/busy brain), in the introduction to any of your thesis reports (to get the reader to understand how this piece fits in the whole puzzle of your work), whenever you have to write for a \u0026ldquo;doctoral consortium\u0026rdquo; or other kind of short presentation about your doctoral work, \u0026hellip; heck, you can put it even in your Ph.D. defense presentation10!  However, not everything about this exercise is great, and there are several circumstances where I would not necessarily recommend to use this:\n If you know for a fact that your advisor (or whatever audience you plan to use it with) dislikes diagrams. \u0026ldquo;Diagrams discourage deep thought and argumentation\u0026rdquo; - I have gotten this remark sometimes from very respected academics, and maybe they have a point. The diagram is not a substitute for a thoughtful, well-argued text (or conversation) describing where your research question comes from and what your contributions are. It is rather a complement - even if it is a very useful one! If you feel that making it is taking too long, or you are endlessly nitpicking about terminology, or you are putting off other important tasks in your Ph.D. to do this (i.e., the diagram has become an act of procrastination). Aside from fully focusing on it when you do it, I also recommend to \u0026ldquo;timebox\u0026rdquo; it11. Remember, this is a tool best used in iteration and communication: rather do a half-baked one in one hour and discuss it with somebody, than spend a whole week on it and end up unsure of whether it is the perfect version (tip: it never is). If you and everyone involved is crystal clear on what the topic is, or you have your topic and contributions well described somewhere else in relatively short form (e.g., in your initial Ph.D. research plan) - provided that nothing much has changed in your ideas described there. If you want to highlight the research methodology you use (a glaring omission in the current version of the diagram) or other kinds of temporal structure or tasks/plans in your Ph.D.. There are other representations more adequate for that kind of thing, like Gantt charts or other task-flow diagrams (I also used some of those in my thesis - maybe a topic for a future post?). If you\u0026rsquo;re not taking the exercise seriously or you think it is utterly useless. But this is a general rule: never do anything you think is meaningless, if you can avoid it :)  Try it out\u0026hellip; and let me know how it goes That\u0026rsquo;s it. I hope this small tool is useful for you in progressing towards a complete dissertation. Now, this diagram is most useful if you actually go and do it. Get off your seat, go for a walk, then sit down again for one or two hours (with your phone in flight mode). Paint it with colored pencils, hand-draw it in the back of the proverbial napkin, use your computer, whatever. Bonus points if you then share it with your advisor or a colleague or anyone.\nJust do it \u0026ndash; and let me know how it goes in the comments.\nAlso, do you have other diagrams or thinking tools that helped you greatly in advancing in your PhD? let me know in the comments below - I\u0026rsquo;ll be glad to share other tools like this in the future.\n See, for example, this post by Jason Fried. [return] Contrary to other universities/faculties, in that field and university it is common to start the Ph.D. with a vaguely-defined research topic and questions. In other places, an initial Ph.D. proposal already has to have a quite clear research question, methodology and research plan behind it (at least, on paper). The diagram could also be very useful even to develop such initial research proposal.

Is this problem real and, if so, how bad is it? In this post, I review several recent studies, some of which also offer insights about potential risk factors. This also kickstarts the whole idea of this blog, as a way to increase awareness about these difficulties, and offer practical tips and tricks to survive such a difficult period.\nThe other day I encountered a colleague at the university. When I first met her, more than two years ago, she seemed a very active, positive person, with an iron will and lots of initiative, a true go-getter. Now, when I talked to her, she still smiled, but a light inquiry into how things were going quickly revealed her many struggles, from unhelpful supervisors to problems with some of the software she has to use on a daily basis. Subsequent times we\u0026rsquo;ve met recently have led to similar exchanges: \u0026ldquo;everything is a problem\u0026rdquo;, is one of her most frequent sentences now.\nOf course, many things may have happened for this person to change her attitude so starkly, but there is one thing I know for sure about her: she has been doing a PhD for the last two years. And I have been around PhD students long enough now, in different labs and different countries (including my own PhD) to know that this is not an isolated case. Interestingly, when I was a knowledge worker in the industry, such emotional downturns were relatively uncommon, so\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s going on here?\nWell, doing a PhD is hard. Anyone will tell you that, from the university professor, to the baker whose cousin is a lab rat. However, we often understand that as: oh, you have to be really smart to do it. But maybe it is not the smarts (or lack thereof) that makes it difficult.\nI recently crossed this problem again in the generalist press, and apparently this topic appears in the news from time to time. It just seems to be largely ignored, or thought to be \u0026ldquo;the way things are\u0026rdquo;. But the first link above referenced a couple of concrete, recent research studies, so I decided to start digging\u0026hellip; is there more to this than my subjective perceptions?\nWhat the some research says Apparently, some researchers must be getting worried about this, because I found quite a few interesting studies done in the last couple of years. For instance, a recent study on more than 2,000 graduate students from 26 countries1 found that about 39% of them had moderate or severe depression symptoms (and 41% of them had moderate/severe anxiety symptoms). This does not mean much (who is not depressed these days with all the fake news and stuff?) until you read that the prevalence of depression symptoms in the general population is less than 6%2! Another study done in Belgium last year3 found similar rates of mental health symptoms (30%-50% depending on the severity) in more than 3,600 PhD students. There, they also do a comparison to understand how high that is: the prevalence of the same symptoms in \u0026ldquo;highly educated\u0026rdquo; general population is around 14%-27% 4. In a study in Brazil, about 21% seemed to be the prevalence of major depression symptoms in graduate students 5. Going a bit back in time, and to other countries, we find different numbers: 8.9% (France, 2010 6), 27% (Turkey, 2008 7), 13% (US, 2007 8), or 5% (Brazil again, in 1995 9)\u0026hellip; It is interesting how data varies quite a lot from country to country (but also for the general population, symptoms for depression in Brazil are 22% in the latest study, vs. the 6% of Germany), and over time (in the Brazilian 1995 study they mention a general population prevalence of 2%!). On top of that, other factors can be at play, like selection bias (not all studies are from cross-sectional or representative samples).\nThe studies also point out some factors that seem to correlate with such symptoms: gender, having children or a partner, perceived work-life balance, or quality of the student\u0026rsquo;s supervision. Some of these vary from study to study, but many seem to be common. There is quite a lot to be said about this topic of what seems to correlate with depression in doctorate students, so I will cover that separately in an upcoming post.\nConclusion Then, the question remains: are you at a greater risk of depression if you do a PhD? It seems that it depends a lot on where you are in the world: in a country where people may have already other reasons for depression generally (like Brazil?), the number is quite close to the general population; but in a relatively \u0026ldquo;happy\u0026rdquo; country like Germany, the chances of being depressed seems to multiply by 5 or more if you are a PhD student!\nIn absolute terms, across studies, the most recent numbers seem to be that around 25-50% of students show moderate or severe depression symptoms. That\u0026rsquo;s one in four, up to one in every two students! Certainly something to watch out for.\nIn practice - a call to action And how is this useful, what can you do now that you know this?\n If you are a PhD student and you\u0026rsquo;re feeling a bit down (and chances are you have felt this in the past, or will in the future), at least know that you are not alone. This is not to say: \u0026ldquo;yeah, this is normal, so buckle up and go on\u0026rdquo;. Mental wellbeing is just as important as physical health (but we talk much less about it, and it is a well-known taboo in many societies). If we start coughing and feeling dizzy, we try to self-diagnose (e.g., with a thermometer), and if it seems serious, we go to the doctor. Well, there are questionnaires like the PHQ-9 (used in many of the studies above), which you can take in order to get an idea of how bad it is. At the very least, talk to somebody, anybody you trust - and if it\u0026rsquo;s bad, go to your doctor, or an specialist! If you are friends or family with a PhD student, you can just keep a friendly eye on them, check in with them from time to time, maybe point them to this blog if you think this information can be useful for them. And if they mention many of the symptoms that appear in these self-tests, maybe suggest them to self-diagnose or see a doctor. If you are a supervisor, you can periodically interest yourself in your students\u0026rsquo; morale and again suggest self-diagnosis or seeing a doctor if you think something is going on. If you think all this talk of depression is nonsense (\u0026ldquo;nobody cared about my depression when I did my PhD!\u0026ldquo;), think again: will anyone benefit if your student drops out (or worse) tomorrow? Your research won\u0026rsquo;t, for sure. In a later post I will also write about the whole students dropping out issue. If you are considering to do a PhD, think about this carefully, and consider yourself warned. True, thousands of people do PhDs successfully every year, but that does not mean there is no suffering on the way; a PhD can also be one of the happiest, most fulfilling episodes of your life (at least mine was so for the most part). Just be aware of the risks (see a later post for more about the risk factors and correlates). Be prepared. For me, personally, as a novice PhD supervisor, this has motivated me to learn more about these mental wellbeing issues, and other techniques and tools to help my students be more productive and (why not) happier during the PhD. I want to be prepared to help others. I will be documenting my discoveries in this blog, and I hope you will find them useful.

Do you feel like everyone else is finding their path \u0026ldquo;naturally\u0026rdquo;, but you don\u0026rsquo;t?\nAre you supervising doctoral students, but feel like you are basically \u0026ldquo;improvising\u0026rdquo;, or following whatever behaviors your advisors applied with you, and wonder why nobody teaches you how to do this, why there is no handbook on how to give effective advice? (hint: there are handbooks, but they may not be what you think).\nThen, A Happy PhD may be interesting for you. Here I will share actionable, practical tips and tools that I (and others) have found useful about the art (?) of becoming a researcher and helping others do so.\nI will try to look at problems and situations that many PhD students face, which are not field-specific: from productivity to wellbeing, from conceptualizing your research to writing it up or going to scientific conferences. As much as possible, I will look at what actual research is there on the subject, and propose tips, tricks and tools that may help navigate these situations.\nHowever, do not expect the formal, measured, academic tone of a peer-reviewed publication. This is a blog, not a scientific journal. I hope it will feel more like a conversation with a colleague in a bar, about the everyday problems and solutions that we encounter as we learn to do science and help each other to do it better.\nI hope this blog also becomes a catalyst to create awareness about these seldom-mentioned problems and situations. A place for people to come and talk about these issues, to pose problems, ask questions, suggest solutions, or tips or tools to cover.\nIt is going to be an exciting journey.\nAbout me I am a relatively recent doctor, starting to supervise my own PhD students. Despite my arguably short scientific career, I am amazed at the variety of supervision styles and workplace dynamics that I have seen in different fields and labs, and the wild variety of doctoral student experiences resulting from it \u0026ndash; many of which are not very productive or healthy. I have the impression we are selling our students short, just because we were sold short ourselves.\nI am also surprised to find that many of my more experienced colleagues seem to face the same hurdles and issues that I find, and shrug defeatedly when I ask for solutions. Much of the written advice I\u0026rsquo;ve found on supervision was either too abstract, or too specific to one field or a particular situation or institution. I wonder if there are not patterns, practices, solutions that people have found as they do this for decades and decades. I have found a few that worked for myself and people I know, and I will share them here.\nIn summary, I am just a beginner on this. I hope to learn a lot by investigating and writing about this, and I will be glad to have you come along.\nDisclaimer The advice in this blog (especially when I write about delicate issues like mental health and depression) is not a substitute for a experienced researcher in a particular field, or a professional therapist. However, whenever possible I will point to research or self-diagnose tools that may help you determine whether you need more expert advice.\n","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/about/","tags":["About"],"title":"About"}]
