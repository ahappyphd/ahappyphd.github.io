[{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"Writing (papers or the dissertation itself) is one of the activities that many doctoral students hate the most. Why is this act of communication so difficult for us? As a prelude to my post on \u0026ldquo;how I write papers\u0026rdquo;, I expose some misconceptions we seem to have about scientific writing and what are good ways to learn it.\nScientific writing is one of the most dreaded tasks for many Ph.D. students1, and understandably so. Unless you are in the humanities, you probably signed up to \u0026ldquo;do science\u0026rdquo;: do experiments, gather evidence, analyze data, read tons of books\u0026hellip; not to become an accomplished writer! To make matters worse, doctoral programs have surprisingly little training on basic (and specifically scientific) writing skills. It seems like we either assume that 1) people come to the doctoral level already knowing how to write scientific texts; or 2) it is such an easy skill to master that it\u0026rsquo;s pointless to teach it. Lets look at these two assumptions:\nIt is an easy skill. Sadly, for most doctoral students, their scientific writing training is reduced to \u0026ldquo;read a lot of scientific papers and you will get it\u0026hellip; eventually\u0026rdquo;. But probably you see the problem here: it is quite difficult to acquire a skill to make something just by seeing finished products (i.e., published papers). This is a bit like training bakers to make bread, just by showing them finished, beautifully decorated loafs of bread and baguettes. Imagine bakers not being encouraged to get their hands dirty with flour! Luckily, our bakers probably get proper vocational training in which they see how their products are manufactured from start to finish. As a consequence, I have yet to meet a baker that is terrified of making bread.\n\r\r\rA baker scared of bread\n\r\r\rPeople already know how to write. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s what our primary and secondary schools are for, right? or the bachelors, or the masters. The problem is that scientific writing is a very particular genre, with values and criteria that are quite different from literary writing (which focuses on aesthetics or emotional impact), political or marketing writing (focusing on persuasion, when not obfuscation), or the kind of \u0026ldquo;composition piece writing\u0026rdquo; that many of us learned at school (which focuses on piling up text until you have X number of words). This kind of \u0026ldquo;writing by accumulation of words\u0026rdquo; leads to doctoral student texts often lacking structure, preciseness, and being an over-long mishmash of ideas. Scientific writing focuses on logical argumentation, clarity of concepts, unambiguity, traceability of sources\u0026hellip; very, very different from any other genre. Coming back to the baker metaphor, it\u0026rsquo;s like trying to make soufflés when you have been doing coarse whole-wheat bread all your life (it might not occur to you that texture is important, or that you can actually put sugar in these things!).\n\r\r\rA baker not used to sugar\n\r\r\rAside from these two misconceptions, there are plenty of other complicating factors, like the fact that English (the dominant language in most scientific fields) is not the native language of a big majority of our doctoral students. Most of our training as writers has probably developed in an entirely different language. Try to make a soufflé after growing up somewhere in Asia where wheat or milk were rare or unheard of\u0026hellip;\nAnd there is yet another difference between scientific writing and other genres: it is, more often than not, a collaborative process. Although, as a doctoral student, you find yourself writing mostly on your own, chances are that you will get feedback from your advisors or other colleagues at some point. During the publishing process, reviewers and editors will also help you make a better paper out of your ideas (even if we do not always perceive it as a collaboration). This collaborative nature of scientific writing begs many questions: at what point should I share my ideas with collaborators, and in which form? is it better to do it often or rarely? what if they are too busy or too slow? et cetera. Again, if you have never baked bread with other people, it may be puzzling who should do what, and at what point in time.\n\r\r\rCollaborative bakery is not easy\n\r\r\rThese misconceptions and differences (along with the fact that more senior researchers and advisors seldom recognize having difficulties in writing) lead to students being ashamed when they have writing problems, which in turn leads to anxiety, \u0026ldquo;writer\u0026rsquo;s block\u0026rdquo;, etc. Maybe this is also why I seldom get the question \u0026ldquo;How do you write papers?\u0026ldquo;.\nSo, you did not ask for it but\u0026hellip; In the next post, I will share the step-by-step process I find myself following after (collaboratively) authoring and publishing more than 70 scientific papers. The misconceptions and issues that I just described have shaped that writing process, as well as the principles behind it (my \u0026ldquo;10 commandments of writing\u0026rdquo;, also in a later post). For now just remember that, as a Ph.D. student, you are not alone in these hardships. We all faced them. We all learned\u0026hellip; eventually. More or less.\nTalk to others.\nSee how they get out of their writer\u0026rsquo;s block.\nDo you agree with these problems and misconceptions? Do you think there are other, more important factors that make scientific writing difficult? Let me know in the comments!\n Wellington, J. (2010).

I hope that the awareness of these factors (from gender to other things you can actually change in your everyday life) will help you understand why some people struggle doing a PhD, while for others it seems a piece of cake. Change what you do and put the odds on your side!\nAs we have seen, depression and anxiety are an increasingly common ailment of Ph.D. students. So much so that, if you don\u0026rsquo;t experience these symptoms yourself during the Ph.D., chances are somebody else around you (e.g., a colleague, or a friend) will.\nThe good news is that many of these studies that determined how frequent mental health issues are in the Ph.D., also investigate what factors seem to correlate (and how much) with symptoms of anxiety or depression (or stress in general). Let\u0026rsquo;s review the most common ones.\nThe Big Five As it often happens when you start reading research studies on anything, each study is a bit different, measures things differently, was done on a different population\u0026hellip; so it is hard to have a single, very accurate picture. Yet, there are five factors that appear again and again in the studies on doctoral student mental health:\n Gender: In many of the studies I have read gender was discovered to be significantly related with depression and anxiety symptoms. For instance, in a recent study, women were about 17% more likely to be depressed than men1, and in another around 27% more likely2. Often, the effect on anxiety is even higher than on depression3. Being trans-gender or being gay have also been related even more strongly with depression (in different studies, trans were 60% more likely1, and gay were almost 4 times as likely than heterosexuals3). Why is this? Multiple things can be at play: the fact that many academic fields are still male-dominated (and heterosexuals dominate in almost any population), which can lead to students not feeling like \u0026ldquo;they belong\u0026rdquo;4; or the fact that, in many cultures, women tend to have less difficulty in expressing their emotions, which is what many of the mental health questionnaires ask about (so, rather than men not being depressed, they might just be hiding it more)5. Strong social ties are another factor that appears very often in these studies. By this I mean really close social relationships like having children (which lowered the odds of being depressed by about 35%2). In many of the studies, being married or having a stable partner also were related with lower rates of depression (in one study, 42% lower odds of depression3). It looks like having somebody to talk and support you through the hardships of the doctorate, or someone that really clarifies your priorities (as a crying baby often does), can be quite protective against the rumination and thought patters that lead to depression. Economic situation is another one that comes up quite often: not surprisingly, having problems making ends meet does not help with anxiety and depression. However, the effect varies a lot from study to study, and from country to country, from 5% more chances6 to almost three times more likely to get depressed3. Even the economic situation of your parents seems to have this effect!7 And the problem is, in most countries, being a PhD student is a low-pay, high-workload job. Related to this issue, how do you perceive your career prospects (i.e., will there be a good job for you after the doctorate) is also mentioned in several places as having an impact in the mental health of PhD students5,8. Work-life balance. This one is not very surprising either, and it is named and measured in different ways: family-work conflict, job demands vs. job control, \u0026hellip; People that perceive their work-life balance to be unhealthy, are more than twice as likely to be depressed1, and experiencing work-family conflicts can also raise your odds of depression between 30-50%2. High job demands (defined as \u0026ldquo;physical, social or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical or mental effort\u0026rdquo;) also seem related to depression (60% more likely2). Conversely, having high job control (of your work environment, pace of work, timing of breaks, etc.) seems to lower the chances of depression by about 40%2. Supervisor relationship. This is the one many of you were waiting for. Researchers have dedicated a lot of effort to study this factor from different angles, like the prior expertise of the supervisor, the supervisory style, leadership style\u0026hellip; However, the results here are rather heterogeneous, and their importance varies a lot8. People who perceive their supervisor as not providing mentorship, support, or emotional impact, were 50% more likely to be depressed in one study1, while in some other research, having an \u0026ldquo;inspirational\u0026rdquo; supervisor lowered the odds of depression by about 10%2. In the same study, having a \u0026ldquo;laissez-faire\u0026rdquo; kind of supervisor raised the odds of depression/anxiety symptoms between 4-8%. In general, this issue of the supervisor style is quite difficult to tackle, as it seems to be also very cultural, and very personal (some studies mention that the important thing is that supervisor and student styles are compatible). I will dedicate a separate post to this issue alone.  There are plenty of other factors that have been studied, but either their change in odds is small9, or there is not enough agreement about them across studies. There is also the issue of whether these factors are causes or effects. When reading this, one should bear in mind the old adage: \u0026ldquo;correlation is not causation\u0026rdquo;. Most probably, the relationship between depression and these demographic and contextual factors is quite complex, with confounding factors and feedback loops. The way I see it: the Ph.D. is a highly uncertain, intense, ill-defined process where often long stretches of time pass without any meaningful feedback about whether you\u0026rsquo;re making any progress. Hence, it is crucial to have a variety of social (and economic) support to remind you that you are a worthy human being (and to lower the stakes of such huge effort).\nBut wait, you may say: why are you telling us about these risk factors, if they are all things we have little control about? It is not like we are going to have kids or change gender just to protect ourselves from depression. It is true that these demographic factors are the most studied so far, probably because they set some kind of baseline, your starting point for the odds of being depressed. But, once you know this starting point, this is when the fun begins\u0026hellip;\nWhat can you actually do? One interesting thing about many of these studies on risk factors for anxiety and depression, it that they run these regression models on multiple factors, which includes some measures of how predictive they are. For example, some paper2 might tell you that their R-squared was 0.2, meaning that their model (taking into account supervision, gender, and several other things) explains only 20% of the variance of the data. That also means there is an 80% of the variance (read: whether you get depressed or not) that must be due to other things: personal factors, individual circumstances and events, etc. This is compatible with the arguments of many positive psychologists, which say that our happiness is a composite of genetic factors (about 50%, according to some accounts), our current circumstances (10%), and an ample 40% for what they call \u0026ldquo;intentional activity\u0026rdquo;, i.e., things we can actually do to change our happiness levels 10.\nSo, has science also studied what Ph.D. students can do to avoid depression and anxiety? Yes. Kinda. Truth is, the evidence on these is normally from smaller, non-representative populations (e.g., there is a ton of studies on just psychology doctoral students). Thus, there are not big guarantees that the results will apply to you. In any case, here are a few ideas:\n Sleep. Having healthy sleep habits is one of the most powerful correlates against depression across studies. And it maybe the one that appears most consistently across the studies I\u0026rsquo;ve read, both when studying stress 11,12,5 and depression13 of doctoral students. Hence, if you found in my first blog post that you might be at risk of depression, and you see that sleep can be a problem for you, maybe trying to fix your sleep hygiene14 is the first thing I would try. If just fixing your sleep hygiene does not cut it, I\u0026rsquo;ve had quite good results with progressive muscle relaxation exercises, but you can also look around in the web for other techniques, or go to a sleep therapist.\n Social support. This is the other big, consistent contributor to avoid depression across studies 5,12,15, as already hinted by some of the other factors mentioned above. One might think that our social circles (i.e., how many friends or acquaintances we have) are not really under our control. However, there are things one can decide to do, like seeking help (one study7 found that help-seeking behaviors are relatively rare among depressed students, only about 30%), or joining a writing support group8, if your university has one. Heck, just heading out for a social evening with friends or colleagues can take you out of your rut if you do it wholeheartedly (even if it is, of course, the last thing you want to do when you are in a depressed mood).\n Exercise. This is another well-known one. However, from the studies I\u0026rsquo;ve read the effect is not always clear: in some studies it is found as a protective factor against psychological ill health16, in others it is not significant12, while in others it is correlated with higher stress! (although the authors argue that this is due to students already using exercise as a coping strategy against the stress that is already there)11. In general, I think it is safe to assume that being in good physical health makes you less prone to falling into depression5,17, so keeping some exercise routine, eating healthily16, etc. is probably a good idea.\n Mindful acceptance. Now we come to the less-well-known ones. I was quite surprised to find some studies looking at this trait in students, and finding very large effects or correlations with lower perceived stress (more than twice as much as the sleep hygiene in one study12, and also found significant in others18). Despite the new-agey name, this is not to be confused with practicing mindfulness meditation (which was not found a significant predictor in some of the same studies, once you control for this acceptance trait12). Looking around, I found definitions like \u0026ldquo;experiencing events fully and without defense, as they are\u0026rdquo;19, or \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; one lets go of judgment, interpretation, and/or elaboration of internal events, and makes no attempt to change, avoid, or escape from the internal experience [\u0026hellip;] not to be confused with passivity or resignation\u0026rdquo;20. While this might look like a fixed personal trait (you either accept stuff, or you don\u0026rsquo;t), there seem to be ways to train it21. Another topic to dig deeper in a later post\u0026hellip;\n Cognitive reappraisal. Loosely defined as reinterpreting an emotional episode22, this kind of mental technique was found to correlate with lower stress in some of the studies on doctoral students12, but was not found significant in all of them18. Again, I make a mental note to dig deeper into this one, and see if there are easy practices or habits to develop it.\n  Put the odds on your side In summary, it seems that there are a few demographic and contextual factors that seem to be related with higher chances of depression and anxiety - but while they seem to be cumulative, they are not ultimately decisive. Everything in life is a bet, so for this one:\n If you are a Ph.D. student, it is probably good to know your base chances, given the factors above\u0026hellip; but also to know what you can do to prevent it (or at least put the odds on your side). Along with the diagnostic tools we saw in the first post, this gives you a basic toolkit to see how you\u0026rsquo;re doing, understand that many in your position have had similar trouble, and do what you can to help yourself or seek help. If you are thinking of starting a Ph.D., maybe take a look at these factors. If you tick many of the \u0026ldquo;bad boxes\u0026rdquo; above\u0026hellip; this does not necessarily mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it. Diversity is one thing we need in many fields, science included. But rather, understand that it may get difficult at times, that you need to brace yourself, be especially careful in the preventive side and go for it if that\u0026rsquo;s what you want! If you are a supervisor (or a university decision-maker), you may want to check with your students: what is their economic situation? do they have a social circle to support them? are they sleeping? You cannot take many lifestyle choices for them, but there are things among these factors that you can influence (maybe rethink that \u0026ldquo;laissez faire\u0026rdquo; strategy, if that\u0026rsquo;s your advisor style). If your are friends or family with a Ph.D. student, you can also do a quick factor assessment, and be especially attentive if the odds look bad; check in with them from time to time, get out and spend some quality time with them. As you saw above, that alone can go a long way. Telling them about these studies probably won\u0026rsquo;t hurt either.  Despite the depressing tone of all this, do not despair! I also see every day doctoral students that are curious, engaged, having a blast learning to be researchers. Knowing that other, darker paths exist, and knowing your odds, is just a start towards avoiding them. Let us see what other things we discover to keep ourselves on the bright side of science.\n Evans, T. M., Bira, L., Gastelum, J. B., Weiss, L. T., \u0026amp; Vanderford, N. L. (2018).

The good thing about this questionnaire and the whole concept of \u0026ldquo;sleep hygiene\u0026rdquo; is that it is habit- and environment-based, so in order to improve it, you only have to start changing your habits and environment towards fewer of these bad habits (which is something you have quite a bit of control about).\r[return] Quina Galdino, M.

But at some point, I realized that other, more selfish, reasons were playing out as well. In this personal account I reflect on a chronic problem of academics and Ph.D. students alike, and how I face it through this blog.\nI open my eyes. It\u0026rsquo;s 6:30am. I do not have to wake up for another hour or so. I know my body and my brain would benefit from sleeping again, but it\u0026rsquo;s no use. I\u0026rsquo;m wide awake.\nIn bed, I spend an indeterminate amount of time revising the never-ending list of to-do\u0026rsquo;s for the day: meetings that I dread about administrative tasks and topics that I\u0026rsquo;m barely interested in, reports and funding grants I have to write, emails apologizing for the (now chronic) delays in the latest experiment I\u0026rsquo;m trying to run\u0026hellip;\nAt some point I catch my train of thought: this circular revision of obligations is useless, everything is anyways noted down in my trusted task list. I try to focus a bit on how my body is feeling. The familiar sensations are back. The small knot in the stomach. The tension in the jaw. The heaviness in the eyes. My mind races again, churning new problems - including the fact that I have too many problems. After another while, I decide to get up and do something. Should I catch up with yesterday\u0026rsquo;s emails? Write up a bit more of the latest paper draft, which has been festering in my hard drive for the last months? I extend my arm out of the bed, towards my phone.\nI stop right there, arm in the air. What\u0026rsquo;s important now?\nI get up, go to the kitchen, and I sit down for a few minutes, doing nothing, just trying to follow my own breath. Of course, it is useless. The latest student report that needs feedback, the document for the bid of the new software, all come back around my head. But I try again for a few more minutes. Back to the breath. The class I need to teach later today. Back to the breath.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read enough about this to know what is happening. Today is one of those days. As the day unfolds, I expect some of the other symptoms of low-grade anxiety1 and depression2: the veil of negativity when people propose well-intentioned solutions and ideas to help me (it is so easy to see all the ways in which such ideas can fail), the upwelling of emotion at semi-random moments (sometimes inspiring to the point of tears; but more often as despair, or even despairing at other people\u0026rsquo;s inspiration).\nAnd the reader will surely think: what are you complaining about? You have already your Ph.D., you have a stable(-ish) job in academia, no big personal troubles\u0026hellip; You\u0026rsquo;ve been lucky, you are successful already! That\u0026rsquo;s the salt rubbing on the wound: shouldn\u0026rsquo;t success feel great? Why does it taste of overwhelm? Truth is, success never stopped successful people from feeling depressed or suicidal (ask Kurt Cobain, or these long lists of famous suicidal scientists).\nI get up from the chair, somewhat more focused. I lay down on a yoga mat and stretch for a few minutes. Then I sit down and write. I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel like it. Yet, among the many worries, also one or two ideas had appeared about things that could be useful for others.\nI type furiously. Some sentences seem brilliant, and the hope that they will inspire somebody to change what they do and feel better almost makes me cry. Stupid. After a few sentences, the fountain of words in my head seems to dry up. I stare at the screen. I can feel the fear of failure tightening its grip on my chest: what if people don\u0026rsquo;t like this either? surely others have written about this more eloquently, and with more knowledge than mine? worse, what if nobody reads it? I force myself to write a few more words, not even complete sentences. Just endings or beginnings, like pieces of stairs leading nowhere. Sometimes I cringe at the words that appear on the screen. But I leave them there for now. Probably today\u0026rsquo;s negative frame of mind is not the best to judge their value.\nTwenty-five minutes later, a faint bell rings. The knot in my stomach is still there\u0026hellip; but somehow, it feels less important. My head is a bit clearer. I look at the page. This is not a blog entry yet, only some jambled sentences, keywords and a lot of \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. But it is a beginning3. Somehow, I feel a certain sense of achievement. I have some power for change in the world. Not much. Only a tiny little. Maybe just a percent of a probability of helping somebody, of making the world less of a grim place.\nThis is the second reason why I write these jambled things. Not only to help with something I see around me more and more often: at the university, at home, among my friends and other people of my age. The young professional that stands frozen in his car, prey of an anxiety crisis. The friend that died of a heart attack at 36 due to overwork. And many more like me, with much lighter symptoms. We are among you. And we are legion.\nThe second reason I do this is to help myself out of it.\nOf course, not everyone is like this. There is those people that have the twinkle in the eye, the zest in the voice, which always seem to have ideas, to speak passionately, to inspire while they teach. Maybe I was one of them only a few years ago. But maybe some of those are also like us. I have learned to mistrust outward appearances (or Facebook feeds, for that matter) of success and happiness. The struggle inside, the impostor syndrome, the secret failues \u0026ndash; those we never see. The halo effect when we see others, and the negativity bias when we look at ourselves \u0026ndash; what a dangerous cocktail!\nYet, what can you do? Well, you can start with a couple of things:\n Talk to others about how you feel. Believe me, getting things off your chest (to your partner, to your boss, to a trusted colleague, a close friend or the waiter at the bar) will feel better than just marinating your brain endlessly with them. They might surprise you with the revelation that they feel the same. Or they will give you a different point of view, point out the many positives in your life, or at least show you that they understand. Of course, you will not agree. You will not believe them. Not at first. But let those things marinate in your head for a while\u0026hellip; Find a purpose. Any purpose4. It can be volunteering at your local charity, creating Youtube videos to help others cook delicious meals, the smile of your baby at 4am (just when you thought you were about to kill him). Or it can be how your research will help cure diseases, advance human knowledge or lead to a better world for everyone. Find something that gets you up in the morning (maybe not every day, but most days). And use it. Remind yourself of it.  I will be here.\nWriting.\n If you are curious about anxiety and its symptoms, there are plenty of resources online to educate the general public about it, such as this one at the Mayo Clinic, or this other one. If you want to check yourself for these symptoms, you can resort to widely-used self-report tests like the GAD07.\r[return] Similarly, for the curious about depression, you can read this, this, or assess yourself with tests like the PHQ9. And, of course, you can check out my first post on depression in the Ph.D.\r[return] To give you an idea, writing this blog entry took about 4 mornings like this one. Plus a bit more time for editing and making it ready for publication.\r[return] Please note I didn\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;follow your passion\u0026rdquo; or something like that. I\u0026rsquo;m under the impression that looking for a purpose out of ourselves, bigger than ourselves, might work better than following a \u0026ldquo;passion\u0026rdquo; for cycling, Swedish movies, or collecting cars. But let\u0026rsquo;s leave such psycho-philosophical discussion on purpose for another entry\u0026hellip;\r[return]  ","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/posts/second-reason/","tags":["Personal","Wellbeing","Anxiety"],"title":"The second reason why I write this blog"},{"categories":["Blog"],"contents":"This is one of the most basic, flexible and effective productivity techniques, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been using for many years. I know many PhD students and academics that swear by it, but I am still surprised by others who do not know about it. In this post I come back to its origins, how to do it, and how I have combined it with other routines to keep me on track. Essential in this age of smartphones, social media and other constant distractions!\nIt is 8:00am. The apartment is quiet and in semi-darkness (the winter sun still hasn\u0026rsquo;t gone up). I put my phone in silent mode, and keep it away from sight. As I sit down to start writing this blog post, I go to my browser and click on the small tomato icon, which turns red, signaling that I have nothing else to do in the next 25 minutes, but write.\nWhat I just described may be quite familiar to some of you: it was me using \u0026ldquo;the pomodoro technique\u0026rdquo;. If somebody asked me which one productivity technique or lifehack I would take to a desert island with me for the rest of my life, it would be this one. By far.\nBut wait, wasn\u0026rsquo;t this blog about PhD students and depression stuff? Well, yes and no. In fact, once people are depressed, probably what they need is a therapist/specialist (not a blogger) to help them out of it. Here, I focus more on the preventive side: how to keep yourself effective and happy so that you finish the PhD and enjoy the ride as much as possible. Once I started looking at the current science of happiness (or \u0026ldquo;positive psychology\u0026rdquo;, as they call it), it seems that having a sense of self-efficacy (read, being and feeling productive) seems to play a large role in it1. So no, not all posts will be depressing - and yes, productivity tips, tricks and routines will feature here from time to time.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s get back to the Pomodoro\u0026hellip;\nA bit of history The Pomodoro Technique \u0026reg; (yes, apparently it is a registered brand) is generally attributed to Francesco Cirillo, who developed it in the 1980s, as a university student looking for \u0026ldquo;a way to get more done in less time\u0026rdquo;. Since then, it has become a very popular \u0026ldquo;lifehack\u0026rdquo;, and now there is an entire book by Cirillo about it2, training courses and certifications, etc. In any case, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t build your whole work life around it, it is a nice little trick to know, and something you can adopt in your own life, right now.\nThis technique is very often used by knowledge workers in many industries, from software development to design, and I know for a fact that many researchers (no matter whether they are early PhD students or seasoned professors) swear by it when they try to stay productive. Oh, and where does the name come from? basically, from the Italian for \u0026ldquo;tomato\u0026rdquo; - Cirillo used a kitchen timer with the shape of a tomato, when he first developed the technique in university.\nHow to do it In case you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go to down to Cirillo\u0026rsquo;s official page (or any of the other dozens of websites and blog posts already describing it), here is a very brief primer on how to start \u0026ldquo;pomodoring\u0026rdquo;, right now:\n Choose a task you want to get done (works especially well for tasks you alone can do, which you\u0026rsquo;ve been procrastinating on). Put away all distractions, especially your phone (which should be put in flight or silent mode) but also email notifications in your computer and other known interruption sources. Make an oath to yourself to work on this task (and only this task) for 25 minutes without interruption. Then, set an actual timer for 25 minutes (some people like physical kitchen timers, but small computer apps also work). Work on the task for the alloted 25 minutes without interruption. Come on, it\u0026rsquo;s just 25 minutes, you can do it! When the timer rings, make a mark on a piece of paper3 and take a break (typically, 5 minutes). Well done! Take a minute to congratulate yourself for advancing in that long-procrastinated task. I\u0026rsquo;m serious. Then, breath, get off your chair, drink a glass of water, stretch, meditate, whatever. That\u0026rsquo;s it!4  Did you do it? How did it feel? Let me know in the comments.\nThe science behind the tomato Despite the technique being mentioned in every other book and article about productivity and graduate students5, there is surprisingly little scientific literature about its use and effectiveness. Aside from several case studies of how it was adopted by different software development firms6, the only real studies I found trying to see if this technique really worked for people was in the field of human-computer interaction, where people design apps to facilitate the practice of the pomodoro, and then evaluate the app (not the method per se). One such study7, about an app that blocks distracting sites in your phone and computer, found that people that used the app did more pomodoros, and felt less stress (the authors argue that it is because you off-load the responsibility of keeping yourself on task to the app). But all these studies tend to be quite small-scale and exploratory.\nOf course, there are plenty of conjectures out there (by Cirillo and others) about why the technique works: because it helps you re-frame time as an event you use to achieve something, instead of a resource you are running out of; the fact that it matches the human attention and focus span; its emphasis on taking breaks periodically (which we too often ignore); etc. But, in the end, it seems that most people supporting it out there, do so out of personal experience. That is also why I recommend it myself: it has worked for me. My guess is that, if you are not a procrastinator, you always get your things done in time and effortlessly\u0026hellip; then, this is not for you. But if you feel overwhelmed by your to-do list (or you don\u0026rsquo;t have a to-do list!) and tend to distract yourself too easily from the important stuff, maybe trying this for a week can change your life forever.\nCaveats As I said, the Pomodoro has been one of my central productivity tricks for many years, and it has helped me greatly when I find myself procrastinating or overwhelmed by obligations at work. However, that does not mean that I use it absolutely all the time. As noted in the Pomodoro booklet and in some criticisms to the technique, there are times when avoiding the Pomodoro is probably a good idea:\n Do not use it when you know you will be interrupted. If you are in your office hours and students are probably coming to see you, or when you are in meetings or your work requires intense teamwork, then it is probably better to not do pomodoros (as it will likely be frustrating to handle what you will see as interruptions). Thankfully, some of the activities in a Ph.D. are solitary almost by definition (e.g., reading, writing your own research), so you will have plenty of opportunity to use the little tomato! Do not use it in your free time. This may seem obvious, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been guilty of trying this myself. As we will see in later posts, resting and unscheduled free time are an essential activity that should be preserved (in the same way sleep is an important part of an athlete\u0026rsquo;s training). Making pomodoros out of leisure activities (e.g., reading a novel for fun) makes them goal-oriented, and will suck the fun out of them very quickly.  Personal experience, tips and tricks In the many years I have been using the Pomodoro technique, I have come across several realizations, tips and tricks about it:\n The timer: When I first discovered the technique, I went out and bought a physical kitchen timer. There was a certain enjoyment in the physicality of setting the timer and hearing the soft tic-tac, but I very soon discovered that not everyone found it as soothing as I did (nor the loud ring at the end!). Since most of my working life occurs within (or nearby) a web browser, I used this nifty little website for a while, and now I use the Marinara Chrome extension. If those options do not fit your particular situation, just pick whatever is easy to call up within your daily routines and workflow (you can Google around for \u0026lsquo;pomodoro timer\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;pomodoro app\u0026rsquo;). I do not recommend using a phone app (the device is often too full of notifications and other potential distractions to outweigh the benefit of the pomodoro). The space: I\u0026rsquo;ve found that how you implement the pomodoro is not as important as where you do it. Choose carefully a space where you are quite sure that no one will interrupt you, and that you will not interrupt or distract yourself. This often rules out your own office, or your kitchen (if you are prone to fridge trips). My personal favorite as of today is the library at our university, as it is close by, it\u0026rsquo;s quite silent, has comfortable chairs/desks, and probably no one is looking for me there8. The distractions. I cannot emphasize this enough: turn off email notifications, and any other notification in your computer (if you are going to work at the computer). And do yourself a favor and put away the phone - really away, as in \u0026ldquo;off your sight, in another room\u0026rdquo; away9. Unless you are expecting a call from the hospital where your grandma is hospitalized, this alone is a productivity tip in itself: once I removed all notifications in my computer (and most of the ones in the phone), my productivity, capacity for attention and general happiness improved markedly. Multi-pomodoro chunks. This is already built-in if you follow Cirillo\u0026rsquo;s full Pomodoro methodology as described in the book. But even if you don\u0026rsquo;t: there is a benefit to doing, say, 4 or 6 pomodoros in a row. There is only so much you can do in 25 minutes, and for really difficult, analytical or creative tasks, a single pomodoro just gets you started. Hence, set aside 2-3 hours for these important, hard tasks, and do several pomodoros in a row, focused on the same task (still taking breaks, but not starting a different task). Peak stress use: I use the technique most intensely (and reap the most benefits from) when facing \u0026ldquo;peak stress\u0026rdquo; moments. Sometimes you have a hard, complex deadline coming close (e.g., when preparing an experiment, when writing a paper or a funding proposal you cannot postpone), and you realize there are still 10-20 different things you need to do in only a few days. In these cases, I just make a list of the tasks, decide their importance, dependencies and sequence, and then budget a number of pomodoros (up to the number of pomodoros I can realistically do in the few remaining days) to each of them. Then, I commit to doing the best I can in the very limited time allotted to each task, but no more (a use of the Pareto principle - you often can get 80% of the results with the first 20% of your efforts). The results are not perfect (tip: they never are), but they are much better than the alternative - an even lousier job due to not sleeping at all, or total breakdown and failing to meet the deadline at all. Effects on mood: Although I only have subjective, anecdotal evidence of this, I have observed that the days when I manage to use this technique more consistently, seem to correlate with more intense feelings of effectiveness and accomplishment. In general, not only more stuff gets done, I\u0026rsquo;m just in a better mood throughout the day! Collective pomodoros: This one is mentioned in Wang et al.\u0026rsquo;s paper6, and I know of Ph.D. students that work in the same office that have used it. Basically, a co-located group of people agrees certain stretches of time to synchronize and do pomodoros together (even if everyone works on their own thing). This social variant of the pomodoro has several intuitive advantages, like reducing interruptions from your co-workers, and allowing for nicer breaks in which you can socialize with your office mates, feel less awkward stretching, etc. In a sense, this is similar to a \u0026ldquo;Shut up and write\u0026rdquo;, to which I will probably dedicate a separate entry in the future.  Just do it. Now. This post just scratched the surface of what the Pomodoro technique can do for you10. If you have read so far and you have not done a pomodoro yet, now it is the time to do so. Go back to the step number 1 above, choose the most important and difficult thing you have to do today, and do a pomodoro. Just one. Just now.\nA small notification appears in the lower right corner of the screen: take a small break. I look at my screen: the text is still convoluted and long, far from perfect, but not too bad for only 25 minutes of work11. As I get up and stretch my arms over my head, I revel in the feeling of having created something (even if it is an incomplete, imperfect something). It was worth the time.\n Ryan, R.

If you get distracted or interrupt yourself to do something else, you don\u0026rsquo;t get to make this mark. If you do more pomodoros about the same task, or about other tasks during the day, this alone can be a primitive way of measuring your productivity.\r[return] There is an additional step, which I consider optional: If you are doing multiple \u0026ldquo;pomodoros\u0026rdquo; in a row, take a longer break (say, 15 minutes) after four of them. Take a walk around the building, go chat with somebody, do some burpees\u0026hellip; do not spend this longer break doing email! (I\u0026rsquo;m often guilty of this one, but then it is not a break)\r[return] See, for example, Lackey, A. E., Moshiri, M., Pandey, T., Lall, C., Lalwani, N., \u0026amp; Bhargava, P. (2014).

This diagram summarizes your main research questions, thesis contributions and evidence of their usefulness. While painful to make, this brutal synthesis exercise is also a powerful communication tool. In this post, I explain how it works, its origins, and how making 18+ versions of it helped me through my PhD. Copy the provided template and use it in your PhD supervision meetings or even in the PhD defense!\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s too hard\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m blank\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what to put there\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;It keeps changing all the time\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard almost every kind of complaint about this tool. However, I still have to find a Ph.D. student that tells me that doing it was useless. It is hard to summarize years of hard work (past and future) into a single page but, as many creative writers will tell you1, being able to distill the most important ideas of a 400-page book into a single page, leads to a clarity of ideas that is often lacking.\nThis is the first of a series of posts on \u0026ldquo;PhD tools\u0026rdquo;: structures, conceptual frameworks or actual hardware/software tools that I (and others) have found useful to advance the Ph.D. dissertation, across different fields. There is lots of general advice out there on how to do diagrams (e.g., for your literature review papers), but not so many that are directly useful for defining the thesis itself. Of course, there are too many research fields and traditions out there, so this particular structure may not fit your particular situation. But I suggest you give it a go - you may be surprised!\nOrigins I first came across this thinking tool when doing my own Ph.D. at GSIC-EMIC, a inter-disciplinary educational technologies lab at the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Back there, it was common advice to fill up one such diagram, once your thesis topic was more or less defined2. Spending an hour diagramming quickly made you realize that things were not as clear as you initially thought, and that your research contributions had more holes than a piece Gruyère cheese\u0026hellip;\nI originally thought that this was just a common researcher device in use everywhere, pretty much like Ellis\u0026rsquo;s problem-goal-question schema0. However, my later travels around different labs have convinced me that this kind of exercise is not common at all (which is why I think this post can be useful). Thus, the diagram is a truly \u0026ldquo;home-brewed\u0026rdquo; thing3, which evolved in an iterative manner since its first (partial) appearance in Asensio-Pérez\u0026rsquo;s thesis0, throughout several other theses45, my own thesis6 and beyond7. We all modified it slightly to fit our particular needs. And we all agree that it was a very useful device to define, understand and communicate our own research.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s hope it helps you too.\nWhat it is As you can see in the thesis references above, the diagram is commonly used in the introduction section of a dissertation, and it is meant to introduce, in graphical form, some of its main elements: the research Context, main research Question, Objectives, Contributions of your thesis and their Evaluation. However, many of us have also used it way before starting to write the dissertation book itself, as a \u0026ldquo;guiding star\u0026rdquo; when discussing with others and planning the thesis work. Below you can see an generic example of such a diagram8. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at each of the elements that make it up:\n\r\r\rA generic CQOCE diagram\n\r\r\r Context. As in, \u0026ldquo;research context\u0026rdquo;. This box is meant to convey where your research sits within the scientific community or communities that are close to what you do. At the beginning of your Ph.D., this box may contain just the name of 1-2 research fields, and/or very general topics within them that interest you. However, as you read more and more literature and understand your field and what is interesting for you, it can become quite specific (see the examples from my own thesis below). Generally, it is also very important to lay out here what is the main problem that you have detected in current research, the \u0026ldquo;hole\u0026rdquo; in the current state-of-the-art that your thesis intends to \u0026ldquo;plug\u0026rdquo;. This basically gives the why of your thesis: what is wrong with our current knowledge of the world, that your thesis tries to make right? Research Question. Probably one of the most obnoxious habits of old professors that one meets randomly during the Ph.D., is to ask: \u0026ldquo;Oh, so you are a doctoral student here\u0026hellip; and what is your research question?\u0026rdquo;. This often leads to the student answering evasively and trying to scurry away. Aside from its obnoxiousness, this question has another interesting property: it is very good at signaling the maturity of a student. If you are able to understand that you are here to further human knowledge, you have identified clearly something that is not known, and formulated it in a single sentence that is actually a question and can be answered with data in a reasonable amount of time, you are almost 50% of the way there (yet another reason why making this diagram is useful). This main research question is probably the element of the diagram that changes most often throughout the Ph.D., normally in the direction from \u0026ldquo;very general, almost impossible to answer even with unlimited funds and manpower\u0026rdquo;, to \u0026ldquo;very specific and convoluted, but with some chance of being answered by a single person in a few years\u0026rdquo;. Objectives: This box tries to answer the question of how would you go about finding out the answer to your research question above. However, it is not really a plan yet: rather, it tries to \u0026ldquo;decompose\u0026rdquo; your research question into more manageable elements, either conceptually (for instance, looking independently into different concepts/keywords that appear in your main research question) or temporally (dealing with A is needed before trying to investigate B). Contributions: This is probably the trickiest element of the diagram to fill in, and the one which I get most questions about. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do a separate post on the whole \u0026ldquo;What counts as a research contribution?\u0026rdquo; question, but here goes the two-sentence version: It is whatever previously unknown, reusable knowledge that you propose or produce during your research, which materializes the answer to your research question. The main problem is that what counts as valid knowledge depends a lot on your research field - which is why you need more experienced peers (like your supervisor, or reading papers from other people in your field), to guide you in defining this. For instance, in many fields (especially, applied ones), a research contribution has to be: a) novel (nobody has done the same or a very similar thing); b) feasible (it can be done practically, it is not just some futuristic fantasy); and c) useful (something that solves an important, relevant problem for some stakeholder). Another tip: very often (but not always), contributions are linked to the different objectives you laid out in the previous box (e.g., each objective is materialized in a contribution that fulfills the objective). Evaluation: Once you have decided what your contribution(s) is/are, you only need to prove that it works as you say it does, e.g., that it is novel, feasible and useful. In many fields, this involves gathering data of some kind from the world, using whatever means at your disposal (from huge radio-telescopes to asking a single person in an interview). This box thus tries to represent graphically how the different data gathering events that you organize, provide this proof for the value of the different contributions you define, to meet the objectives and finally answer the research question of your thesis (see the over-complex examples from my thesis in the figure below).  If all this sounds terribly abstract and vague to you, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you are in good company (everyone thinks so at the beginning). Hopefully, an example will help bring some clarity\u0026hellip; but then again, maybe not, if you are in a field very far away from mine. Therefore, take the example if it helps you, but do not consider it the only way of doing this!\nHow I used it during my Ph.D. Going through my archives from the thesis period, I have found at least 18 different versions of this diagram (hence, not counting those I quickly drew on paper and never made it into my hard drive). Below, you can see three examples spanning the three years that my Ph.D. work lasted: a first one from about six months into the actual Ph.D. work (hand-drawn on the left, mostly in Spanish), another one from around the middle, and the final one that appeared on my dissertation (on the right).\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rCQOCE diagrams for my own thesis, from the beginning of my thesis work (left), mid-way through it (center) and at the defense (right)\n\r\r\rA lot can be said about those particular diagrams (parts of them still make me cringe), but there are three take-aways I want to leave you with: a) your diagram should probably look much simpler than mine (my thesis was too complicated, for reasons I don\u0026rsquo;t need to discuss here); b) it is OK to hand-draw yours (it is often quicker, and has the same communication power); and c) as you can see in the middle one, it is OK to have incomplete or doubtful parts in it. That is the whole point of the diagram: to identify what parts we are unsure of, or have no idea how to deal with, and see how the conception of our own dissertation is changing over time.\nFast-forward six years, and I still use this kind of diagrams when starting a new research line, especially if it is a collaboration with other researchers, and I have to communicate what the main idea and elements of the research are. Which leads me to\u0026hellip;\nWhy use it - and when not to There are several reasons why you might want to give this exercise a go (or recommend it to your students, if you are an advisor):\n It is a useful reflection exercise: In the day-to-day life of a Ph.D. there are so many different tasks, reading papers, planning experiments, gathering data, doing analysis, writing your own papers\u0026hellip; It is very easy for each of these to become a rabbit hole we pursue. Sometimes these meanderings are useful and prompt a permanent change in how you think about your thesis (they become central to it). Sometimes they are just unnecessary distractions. This exercise forces you to stop for a moment 9, and think deeply, and make your current ideas about what you are doing (and why) visible. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t ever show it to anybody else, knowing your direction (or even whether there are gaps in your ideas) feels tremendously empowering. As a reminder and prioritization tool. Once you have a version of the diagram in place (even with holes or question marks in it), you can print it and keep it somewhere visible in your office or workspace. And every time you are analyzing data, or reading an interesting paper, or writing your own, or coming up with ideas for cool experiments, you can look at it and think: does it fit or relate with my main problem? is it central or peripheral to it? does it further my contributions? And depending on what your answer is, you can give it a clear priority compared with your other tasks and ideas (or reject it completely\u0026hellip; until you finish the Ph.D. at least). Or you can quickly draw a new box in the diagram, if you think it is really important. Although the two values above are very important, I think the real killer application of this diagram is as a communication tool: It summarizes, in a single page, what the most important question and ideas of your thesis are, and what you are trying to achieve. It also forces you to decide what the right keywords and terminology to use (something different scientific communities are known to be quite picky about) - and elicit problems with the words you use, once you present it to others. You can use it in your meetings with the Ph.D. advisor (to front-load your topic in your advisor\u0026rsquo;s exhausted/busy brain), in the introduction to any of your thesis reports (to get the reader to understand how this piece fits in the whole puzzle of your work), whenever you have to write for a \u0026ldquo;doctoral consortium\u0026rdquo; or other kind of short presentation about your doctoral work, \u0026hellip; heck, you can put it even in your Ph.D. defense presentation10!  However, not everything about this exercise is great, and there are several circumstances where I would not necessarily recommend to use this:\n If you know for a fact that your advisor (or whatever audience you plan to use it with) dislikes diagrams. \u0026ldquo;Diagrams discourage deep thought and argumentation\u0026rdquo; - I have gotten this remark sometimes from very respected academics, and maybe they have a point. The diagram is not a substitute for a thoughtful, well-argued text (or conversation) describing where your research question comes from and what your contributions are. It is rather a complement - even if it is a very useful one! If you feel that making it is taking too long, or you are endlessly nitpicking about terminology, or you are putting off other important tasks in your Ph.D. to do this (i.e., the diagram has become an act of procrastination). Aside from fully focusing on it when you do it, I also recommend to \u0026ldquo;timebox\u0026rdquo; it11. Remember, this is a tool best used in iteration and communication: rather do a half-baked one in one hour and discuss it with somebody, than spend a whole week on it and end up unsure of whether it is the perfect version (tip: it never is). If you and everyone involved is crystal clear on what the topic is, or you have your topic and contributions well described somewhere else in relatively short form (e.g., in your initial Ph.D. research plan) - provided that nothing much has changed in your ideas described there. If you want to highlight the research methodology you use (a glaring omission in the current version of the diagram) or other kinds of temporal structure or tasks/plans in your Ph.D.. There are other representations more adequate for that kind of thing, like Gantt charts or other task-flow diagrams (I also used some of those in my thesis - maybe a topic for a future post?). If you\u0026rsquo;re not taking the exercise seriously or you think it is utterly useless. But this is a general rule: never do anything you think is meaningless, if you can avoid it :)  Try it out\u0026hellip; and let me know how it goes That\u0026rsquo;s it. I hope this small tool is useful for you in progressing towards a complete dissertation. Now, this diagram is most useful if you actually go and do it. Get off your seat, go for a walk, then sit down again for one or two hours (with your phone in flight mode). Paint it with colored pencils, hand-draw it in the back of the proverbial napkin, use your computer, whatever. Bonus points if you then share it with your advisor or a colleague or anyone.\nJust do it \u0026ndash; and let me know how it goes in the comments.\nAlso, do you have other diagrams or thinking tools that helped you greatly in advancing in your PhD? let me know in the comments below - I\u0026rsquo;ll be glad to share other tools like this in the future.\n See, for example, this post by Jason Fried.\r[return] Contrary to other universities/faculties, in that field and university it is common to start the Ph.D. with a vaguely-defined research topic and questions. In other places, an initial Ph.D. proposal already has to have a quite clear research question, methodology and research plan behind it (at least, on paper). The diagram could also be very useful even to develop such initial research proposal.\r[return] So much so, that it does not even have an official name, as far as I know. \u0026ldquo;CQOCE\u0026rdquo; is just a name I had to invent to write this blog entry!\r[return] For example, p. 6 in Hernández-Leo, D.

You can use the [Pomodoro technique]() to help you with that.\r[return] Indeed, 80% of my Ph.D. defense slides basically walked the jury around the diagram, diving into some of its elements to present related literature, or details of the studies and results. Nobody complained about that use, in fact.\r[return] Timeboxing is another common productivity technique, in which you basically set aside a limited amount of time (e.g., one or two hours) to focus on a task/problem, and stop once the alloted time ends. No matter what. This prevents the task from filling your whole day (especially if other important tasks also need to be done).\r[return]  ","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/posts/cqoce-diagram/","tags":["Toolbox","Diagrams","Thesis"],"title":"PhD tool: The CQOCE diagram"},{"categories":["Pages"],"contents":"Please leave your comments, suggestions (for posts or about the blog), etc. in the form below, or email me at ahappyphd.blog@gmail.com.

Is this problem real and, if so, how bad is it? In this post, I review several recent studies, some of which also offer insights about potential risk factors. This also kickstarts the whole idea of this blog, as a way to increase awareness about these difficulties, and offer practical tips and tricks to survive such a difficult period.\nThe other day I encountered a colleague at the university. When I first met her, more than two years ago, she seemed a very active, positive person, with an iron will and lots of initiative, a true go-getter. Now, when I talked to her, she still smiled, but a light inquiry into how things were going quickly revealed her many struggles, from unhelpful supervisors to problems with some of the software she has to use on a daily basis. Subsequent times we\u0026rsquo;ve met recently have led to similar exchanges: \u0026ldquo;everything is a problem\u0026rdquo;, is one of her most frequent sentences now.\nOf course, many things may have happened for this person to change her attitude so starkly, but there is one thing I know for sure about her: she has been doing a PhD for the last two years. And I have been around PhD students long enough now, in different labs and different countries (including my own PhD) to know that this is not an isolated case. Interestingly, when I was a knowledge worker in the industry, such emotional downturns were relatively uncommon, so\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s going on here?\nWell, doing a PhD is hard. Anyone will tell you that, from the university professor, to the baker whose cousin is a lab rat. However, we often understand that as: oh, you have to be really smart to do it. But maybe it is not the smarts (or lack thereof) that makes it difficult.\nI recently crossed this problem again in the generalist press, and apparently this topic appears in the news from time to time. It just seems to be largely ignored, or thought to be \u0026ldquo;the way things are\u0026rdquo;. But the first link above referenced a couple of concrete, recent research studies, so I decided to start digging\u0026hellip; is there more to this than my subjective perceptions?\nWhat the some research says Apparently, some researchers must be getting worried about this, because I found quite a few interesting studies done in the last couple of years. For instance, a recent study on more than 2,000 graduate students from 26 countries1 found that about 39% of them had moderate or severe depression symptoms (and 41% of them had moderate/severe anxiety symptoms). This does not mean much (who is not depressed these days with all the fake news and stuff?) until you read that the prevalence of depression symptoms in the general population is less than 6%2! Another study done in Belgium last year3 found similar rates of mental health symptoms (30%-50% depending on the severity) in more than 3,600 PhD students. There, they also do a comparison to understand how high that is: the prevalence of the same symptoms in \u0026ldquo;highly educated\u0026rdquo; general population is around 14%-27% 4. In a study in Brazil, about 21% seemed to be the prevalence of major depression symptoms in graduate students 5. Going a bit back in time, and to other countries, we find different numbers: 8.9% (France, 2010 6), 27% (Turkey, 2008 7), 13% (US, 2007 8), or 5% (Brazil again, in 1995 9)\u0026hellip; It is interesting how data varies quite a lot from country to country (but also for the general population, symptoms for depression in Brazil are 22% in the latest study, vs. the 6% of Germany), and over time (in the Brazilian 1995 study they mention a general population prevalence of 2%!). On top of that, other factors can be at play, like selection bias (not all studies are from cross-sectional or representative samples).\nThe studies also point out some factors that seem to correlate with such symptoms: gender, having children or a partner, perceived work-life balance, or quality of the student\u0026rsquo;s supervision. Some of these vary from study to study, but many seem to be common. There is quite a lot to be said about this topic of what seems to correlate with depression in doctorate students, so I will cover that separately in an upcoming post.\nConclusion Then, the question remains: are you at a greater risk of depression if you do a PhD? It seems that it depends a lot on where you are in the world: in a country where people may have already other reasons for depression generally (like Brazil?), the number is quite close to the general population; but in a relatively \u0026ldquo;happy\u0026rdquo; country like Germany, the chances of being depressed seems to multiply by 5 or more if you are a PhD student!\nIn absolute terms, across studies, the most recent numbers seem to be that around 25-50% of students show moderate or severe depression symptoms. That\u0026rsquo;s one in four, up to one in every two students! Certainly something to watch out for.\nIn practice - a call to action And how is this useful, what can you do now that you know this?\n If you are a PhD student and you\u0026rsquo;re feeling a bit down (and chances are you have felt this in the past, or will in the future), at least know that you are not alone. This is not to say: \u0026ldquo;yeah, this is normal, so buckle up and go on\u0026rdquo;. Mental wellbeing is just as important as physical health (but we talk much less about it, and it is a well-known taboo in many societies). If we start coughing and feeling dizzy, we try to self-diagnose (e.g., with a thermometer), and if it seems serious, we go to the doctor. Well, there are questionnaires like the PHQ-9 (used in many of the studies above), which you can take in order to get an idea of how bad it is. At the very least, talk to somebody, anybody you trust - and if it\u0026rsquo;s bad, go to your doctor, or an specialist! If you are friends or family with a PhD student, you can just keep a friendly eye on them, check in with them from time to time, maybe point them to this blog if you think this information can be useful for them. And if they mention many of the symptoms that appear in these self-tests, maybe suggest them to self-diagnose or see a doctor. If you are a supervisor, you can periodically interest yourself in your students\u0026rsquo; morale and again suggest self-diagnosis or seeing a doctor if you think something is going on. If you think all this talk of depression is nonsense (\u0026ldquo;nobody cared about my depression when I did my PhD!\u0026ldquo;), think again: will anyone benefit if your student drops out (or worse) tomorrow? Your research won\u0026rsquo;t, for sure. In a later post I will also write about the whole students dropping out issue. If you are considering to do a PhD, think about this carefully, and consider yourself warned. True, thousands of people do PhDs successfully every year, but that does not mean there is no suffering on the way; a PhD can also be one of the happiest, most fulfilling episodes of your life (at least mine was so for the most part). Just be aware of the risks (see a later post for more about the risk factors and correlates). Be prepared. For me, personally, as a novice PhD supervisor, this has motivated me to learn more about these mental wellbeing issues, and other techniques and tools to help my students be more productive and (why not) happier during the PhD. I want to be prepared to help others. I will be documenting my discoveries in this blog, and I hope you will find them useful.

Do you feel like everyone else is finding their path \u0026ldquo;naturally\u0026rdquo;, but you don\u0026rsquo;t?\nAre you supervising doctoral students, but feel like you are basically \u0026ldquo;improvising\u0026rdquo;, or following whatever behaviors your advisors applied with you, and wonder why nobody teaches you how to do this, why there is no handbook on how to give effective advice? (hint: there are handbooks, but they may not be what you think).\nThen, A Happy PhD may be interesting for you. Here I will share actionable, practical tips and tools that I (and others) have found useful about the art (?) of becoming a researcher and helping others do so.\nI will try to look at problems and situations that many PhD students face, which are not field-specific: from productivity to wellbeing, from conceptualizing your research to writing it up or going to scientific conferences. As much as possible, I will look at what actual research is there on the subject, and propose tips, tricks and tools that may help navigate these situations.\nHowever, do not expect the formal, measured, academic tone of a peer-reviewed publication. This is a blog, not a scientific journal. I hope it will feel more like a conversation with a colleague in a bar, about the everyday problems and solutions that we encounter as we learn to do science and help each other to do it better.\nI hope this blog also becomes a catalyst to create awareness about these seldom-mentioned problems and situations. A place for people to come and talk about these issues, to pose problems, ask questions, suggest solutions, or tips or tools to cover.\nIt is going to be an exciting journey.\nAbout me I am a relatively recent doctor, starting to supervise my own PhD students. Despite my arguably short scientific career, I am amazed at the variety of supervision styles and workplace dynamics that I have seen in different fields and labs, and the wild variety of doctoral student experiences resulting from it \u0026ndash; many of which are not very productive or healthy. I have the impression we are selling our students short, just because we were sold short ourselves.\nI am also surprised to find that many of my more experienced colleagues seem to face the same hurdles and issues that I find, and shrug defeatedly when I ask for solutions. Much of the written advice I\u0026rsquo;ve found on supervision was either too abstract, or too specific to one field or a particular situation or institution. I wonder if there are not patterns, practices, solutions that people have found as they do this for decades and decades. I have found a few that worked for myself and people I know, and I will share them here.\nIn summary, I am just a beginner on this. I hope to learn a lot by investigating and writing about this, and I will be glad to have you come along.\nDisclaimer The advice in this blog (especially when I write about delicate issues like mental health and depression) is not a substitute for a experienced researcher in a particular field, or a professional therapist. However, whenever possible I will point to research or self-diagnose tools that may help you determine whether you need more expert advice.\n","permalink":"http://ahappyphd.org/about/","tags":["About"],"title":"About"}]
